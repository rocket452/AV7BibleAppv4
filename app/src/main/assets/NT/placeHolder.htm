	  The Bible is the greatest source of wisdom and truth known to mankind.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  The AV7 Bible is a word-for-word literal translation of the most trustworthy original language sources of
	  the Bible in present-day English.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  It is a curious compromise of truth that more than 600 different versions and paraphrases of 
	  the Bible have been published in the English language. Because, the truth is, that there can 
	  never be such a thing as different equally trustworthy versions of the truth in any one language.

	  <a href="http://www.comparebibles.com/">How to Compare Bible versions</a>
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  AV7 is an accurate, word-for-word literal translation, not a paraphrase. 
	  This is important because non-literal Bible versions typically include interpretive 
	  words and paraphrasing that may not be accurate, but may instead reflect subjective 
	  ideas, opinions, and doctrinal distinctives.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  AV7 is derived from a 17,342 word AV7 exhaustive concordance that lists every unique
	  Greek word used in original language source texts, their frequency of use, technical
	  specifications, and corresponding direct-equivalent English translation.
      </p>
	  <p>
	  AV7 is easy-to-read in present-day English. It was compiled by a computerized system
	  that uses seven levels of processing to translate original language sources into 
	  grammatically correct English, preserving the literal translation accuracy of the 
	  trustworthy sources.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  AV7 replaces the obsolete and archaic words and phrases found in the traditional 
	  1611 English text (incorrectly and improperly called the King James Version) with 
	  direct-equivalent present-day English words and phrases, using AV7 concordance 
	  translation tables.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  AV7 corrects previous grammatical and translation errors and provides exhaustive
	  documentation to explain the corrections.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  AV7 uses reduced-size italics to identify words that have been added interpolatively
	  to improve the readability and clarity of the text.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  AV7 uses superscript pluses+ as key-word flags to unobtrusively identify significant
	  word revisions and to prompt readers to investigate related word-studies.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  AV7 provides cross-references within the New Testament text to the book, chapter, 
	  and verse for many Old Testament passages that are directly quoted or referenced in
	  the New Testament text.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  AV7 replaces non-essential masculine gender presentation style with more accurate 
	  gender-inclusive wording. For example, inaccurate and grammatically incorrect wording
	  such as "he that" is revised to "those who" where applicable.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  AV7 is validated by exhaustive documentation to explain every detail of its compilation
	  and presentation, word-for-word and phrase-by-phrase.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  AV7 provides line-over-line interlinear comparisons of key "proof" verses.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  AV7 is absolutely free and may be freely copied and distributed without
	  any restrictions for any non-commercial purpose.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  AV7 is not an "All rights reserved" publication that restricts copying
	  and free distribution of the Scriptures.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  AV7 features a Cordial Invitation to encourage those who have never before 
	  done so to accept God's invitation to join His family.	
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  AV7 presents The Most Essential Truths in the Bible in concise, easy-to-read opening pages, 
	  and highlights these essential truths in bordered frames throughout the text in the printed
	  edition, so readers can more easily read the Bible from the inside out.	 
	  </p>
	  <p>
      AV7 is a present-day English presentation of the most trustworthy, word-for-word translation of
      the Bible that has been preserved, refined, and fine-tuned over a span of more than 700 years.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  The AV7 copyright stipulates that it may be freely copied and distributed, with no restrictions
	  and no limits, for any non-commercial purpose.
