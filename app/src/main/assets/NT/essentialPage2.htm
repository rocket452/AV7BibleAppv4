The 10 Commandments<br>
are The Foundation<br>
of All Truth<br></b></font></center>

</center><p><font class=T1>

<b>#1</b>&nbsp; I am the Lord your God . . . you shall have no other gods before me. 
<div id="italicText" >Exodus 20:2-3</div> 
<p>
<b>#2</b>&nbsp; You shall not make any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. You shall not bow down to them nor serve them. For I the Lord your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity~ of the fathers onto the children to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, yet showing mercy to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments. <div id="italicText" >Exodus 20:4-6 </div>
<p>
<b>#3</b>&nbsp; You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain. For the Lord will not hold those guiltless who take His name in vain. <div id="italicText" >Exodus 20:7 </div>
<p>
<b>#4</b>&nbsp; Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days shall you labor and do all your work. The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. In it you shall not do any work, neither you nor your son nor your daughter, your manservant nor your maidservant, your cattle nor your stranger~ who is within your gates. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy+. <div id="italicText" >Exodus 20:8-11 </div>
<p>
<b>#5</b>&nbsp; Honor your father and your mother so that your days may be long on the land that the Lord your God gives to you. <div id="italicText" >Exodus 20:12 </div>
<p>
<b>#6</b>&nbsp; You shall not murder+. <div id="italicText" >Exodus 20:13 </div>
<p>
<b>#7</b>&nbsp; You shall not commit adultery. <div id="italicText" >Exodus 20:14 </div>
<p>
<b>#8</b>&nbsp; You shall not steal. <div id="italicText" >Exodus 20:15 </div>
<p>
<b>#9</b>&nbsp; You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor. <div id="italicText" >Exodus 20:16 </div>
<p>
<b>#10</b>&nbsp; You shall not covet your neighbor's house. You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is your neighbor's. <div id="italicText" >Exodus 20:17 </div>
<p>
<b>#11</b>&nbsp; It is written: Mankind+ shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 4:4, cf. Deuteronomy 8:3 </div>
<p>
<b>#12</b>&nbsp; Again it is written: You shall not tempt the Lord your God. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 4:7, cf. Deuteronomy 6:16 </div>
<p>
<b>#13</b>&nbsp; It is written: You shall worship the Lord your God and Him only shall you serve. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 4:10, cf. Exodus 34:14, Deuteronomy 10:20 </div>
<p>
<b>#14</b>&nbsp; Unless+ a person+ is born again, they cannot see the kingdom of God. <div id="italicText" >John 3:3 </div>
<p>
<b>#15</b>&nbsp; Unless+ a person+ is born of water and of the Spirit, they cannot enter into the kingdom of God. <div id="italicText" >John 3:5 </div>

<p>
<b>#17</b>&nbsp; For God so loved the world, that He gave His Only Begotten Son, so that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal+ life. <div id="italicText" >John 3:16 </div>
<p>
<b>#18</b>&nbsp; For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but so that the world through Him might be saved. <div id="italicText" >John 3:17 </div>
<p>

<b>#20</b>&nbsp; But whoever drinks of the water that I give will never thirst. However, the water that I give will become a well of water within+ them springing up into eternal+ life. <div id="italicText" >John 4:14 </div>
<p>
<b>#21</b>&nbsp; God is Spirit. Those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth. <div id="italicText" >John 4:24</div> 

<p>
<b>#23</b>&nbsp; Repent. For the kingdom of heaven is very near+. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 4:17</div> 
<p>
<b>#24</b>&nbsp; Follow me and I will make you fishers~ of men. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 4:19</div> 
<p>
<b>#25</b>&nbsp; Behold, you are made whole. Sin no more, lest a worse thing come to you. <div id="italicText" >John 5:14</div> 
<p>

<b>#27</b>&nbsp; Those who hear my Word and believe in Him who sent me have eternal+ life and will not come into condemnation, but are passed from death to life. <div id="italicText" >John 5:24</div> 
<p>
<b>#28</b>&nbsp; Those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of damnation. <div id="italicText" >John 5:29</div> 
<p>
<b>#29</b>&nbsp; Search the Scriptures. For in them you think you have eternal life, and they + testify of me. <div id="italicText" >John 5:39, cf. Jeremiah 29:13</div> 
<p>
<b>#30</b>&nbsp; Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 5:3</div> 
<p>
<b>#31</b>&nbsp; Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 5:4</div> 
<p>
<b>#32</b>&nbsp; Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 5:5, cf. Psalm 37:11</div> 
<p>
<b>#33</b>&nbsp; Blessed are those who do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 5:6</div> 
<p>
<b>#34</b>&nbsp; Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 5:7, cf. Proverbs 11:17</div> 
<p>
<b>#35</b>&nbsp; Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 5:8</div> 
<p>
<b>#36</b>&nbsp; Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 5:9</div> 
<p>
<b>#37</b>&nbsp; Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 5:10, cf. Isaiah 8:12</div> 
<p>
<b>#38</b>&nbsp; Blessed are you when people revile you and persecute you and say all kinds+ of evil against you falsely for my sake. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 5:11</div> 
<p>
<b>#39</b>&nbsp; Rejoice and be exceedingly glad. For great is your reward in heaven. For so likewise did they persecute the prophets who were before you. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 5:12, cf. 2 Chronicles 36:16</div> 
<p>
<b>#40</b>&nbsp; You are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its savor, with what will it be salted? It is thereafter+ good for nothing but to be cast out and trampled+ under foot+. <font class=T3>Matthew 5:13</div> 
<p>
<b>#41</b>&nbsp; You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 5:14</div> 
<p>
<b>#42</b>&nbsp; Let your light so shine before people that they may see your good works and glorify~ your Father in heaven. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 5:16</div> 
<p>
<b>#43</b>&nbsp; Do not think that I have come to destroy the law or the prophets. I have not come to destroy, but to fulfill. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 5:17</div> 
<p>
<b>#44</b>&nbsp; Whoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments and shall teach people+ to do so shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever shall do them and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 5:19</div> 
<p>

<b>#53</b>&nbsp; You have heard that it has been said: You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy. But I say to you: Love your enemies. Bless those who curse you. Do good to those who hate you. And pray for those who despitefully use you and persecute you so that you may be the children of your Father in heaven. For He makes His sun to rise on the evil and on the good and He sends rain on the righteous+ and on the unrighteous+. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 5:43-45, cf. Leviticus 19:18, Proverbs 16:7</div> 
<p>

<b>#57</b>&nbsp; Therefore pray in this manner: Our Father in heaven, Holy+ is your name. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 6:9</div> 
<p>
<b>#58</b>&nbsp; For if you forgive others for their trespasses~ then your heavenly Father will also forgive you. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 6:14</div> 

<p>
<b>#61</b>&nbsp; Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust corrupt~ and where thieves break through and steal. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 6:19</div> 
<p>
<b>#62</b>&nbsp; Do not be afraid, little flock. For it is your Father's good pleasure to give the kingdom of God to you. <div id="italicText" >Luke 12:32</div> 

<p>
<b>#65</b>&nbsp; No one can serve two masters. For either they will hate the one and love the other, or else they will hold to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and worldly treasures+. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 6:24</div> 
<p>
<b>#66</b>&nbsp; Take heed and beware of covetousness. For one's life is not to be found in the abundance of things one possesses. <div id="italicText" >Luke 12:15</div> 
<p>

<p>
<b>#73</b>&nbsp; Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things will be added to you. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 6:33</div> 

<p>
<b>#75</b>&nbsp; Do not judge so that you will not be judged. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 7:1</div> 
<p>
<b>#76</b>&nbsp; Give and it will be given to you: Good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, others+ will give to your innermost+ needs. For with the same gauge+ with which you measure+ it will be measured to you again. <div id="italicText" >Luke 6:38</div> 

<p>
<b>#80</b>&nbsp; Ask and it will be given to you. Seek and you will find. Knock and it will be opened to you. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 7:7</div> 
<p>

<b>#82</b>&nbsp; Therefore all things whatsoever you would that others should do to you, you do to them. For this is the sum of the law and the prophets. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 7:12</div> 
<p>

<b>#84</b>&nbsp; Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are greedy+ wolves. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 7:15</div> 

<p>
<b>#86</b>&nbsp; Not everyone who says to me: Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of my Father in heaven. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 7:21</div> 
<p>

<b>#91</b>&nbsp; Go and learn what this means: I will have mercy and not sacrifice. For I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 9:13, cf. Hosea 6:6</div> 
<p>
<b>#92</b>&nbsp; Do not be afraid. Only believe. <div id="italicText" >Mark 5:36</div> 
<p>

<b>#95</b>&nbsp; The kingdom of heaven is very near+. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 10:7</div> 
<p>

<b>#106</b>&nbsp; Therefore do not be afraid of them, for there is nothing covered that will not be revealed and nothing hid that will not be known. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 10:26</div> 

<p>
<b>#109</b>&nbsp; Whoever therefore will confess me before people+, I will confess also before my Father in heaven. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 10:32</div> 
<p>

<b>#114</b>&nbsp; Come to me all you who labor and are heavily burdened+ and I will give you rest. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 11:28, cf. Jeremiah 31:25</div> 
<p>
<b>#115</b>&nbsp; You are overly anxious+ and troubled about so many things. But one thing is necessary+ and Mary has chosen that good part and that will not be taken from her. <div id="italicText" >Luke 10:41-42</div> 

<p>
<b>#118</b>&nbsp; Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation. Every city or house divided against itself will not stand. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 12:25, cf. Proverbs 11:29</div> 
<p>
<b>#119</b>&nbsp; Those who are not with me are against me. Those who do not gather with me scatter. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 12:30</div> 

<p>
<b>#122</b>&nbsp; O generation of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. A good person+ out of the good treasure of the heart brings forth good things. An evil person+ out of evil treasure brings forth evil things. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 12:34-35, cf. Psalm 19:14 Proverbs 10:11</div> 
<p>
<b>#123</b>&nbsp; For every idle word that people+ speak, they will give an account of it on the day of judgment. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 12:36</div> 
<p>
<b>#124</b>&nbsp; Blessed are those who hear the Word of God and keep it. <div id="italicText" >Luke 11:28, cf. Proverbs 8:32</div> 
<p>
<b>#125</b>&nbsp; Whoever does the will of my Father in heaven, the same is my brother and sister and mother. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 12:50</div> 
<p>

<b>#130</b>&nbsp; Be of good cheer~. I Am+ with you. Do not be afraid. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 14:27</div> 

<p>
<b>#132</b>&nbsp; This is the work of God: That you believe in the one whom He has sent. <div id="italicText" >John 6:29</div> 

<p>
<b>#137</b>&nbsp; Those who believe in me have eternal+ life. <div id="italicText" >John 6:47</div> 
<p>

<b>#141</b>&nbsp; It is not what goes into the mouth that defiles, but what comes out of the mouth that defiles. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 15:11, Mark 7:20</div> 
<p>
<b>#142</b>&nbsp; If anyone+ will come after me, let them deny themselves and take up their cross and follow me. For whoever would+ save their life will lose it and whoever would+ lose their life for my sake will find it. For what is anyone to profit if they gain the whole world and lose their own soul? Or what shall anyone give in exchange for their soul? <div id="italicText" >Matthew 16:24, cf. Proverbs 13:7</div> 
<p>
<b>#143</b>&nbsp; If you can believe, all things are possible to those who believe. <div id="italicText" >Mark 9:23</div> 
<p>

<b>#156</b>&nbsp; If anyone thirsts, let them come to me and drink. As the Scripture has said of those who believe in me: Out of their innermost being+ will flow rivers of living water. <div id="italicText" >John 7:37-38, cf. Proverbs 8:17, Isaiah 58:11</div> 
<p>
<b>#157</b>&nbsp; If you continue in my Word then you are indeed my disciples. <div id="italicText" >John 8:31</div> 

<p>
<b>#159</b>&nbsp; If anyone+ keeps my Word+, they will never see death. <div id="italicText" >John 8:51</div> 

<p>
<b>#161</b>&nbsp; I am the door. If anyone enters in through+ me, they will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture. <div id="italicText" >John 10:9</div> 
<p>
<b>#162</b>&nbsp; The thief does not come, except+ to steal, kill, and destroy. I have come so that they might have life and have it more abundantly. <div id="italicText" >John 10:10, cf. Jeremiah 29:11</div> 
<p>

<b>#177</b>&nbsp; I am the resurrection and the life. Those who believe in me, though they were dead, yet shall they live. Whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this? <div id="italicText" >John 11:25-26</div> 
<p>

<b>#182</b>&nbsp; He who made them at the beginning of the creation made them male and female and said: For this reason+ a man shall leave father and mother and cleave to his wife and they two shall be one flesh. Therefore they are no longer+ two but one flesh. So then, they are no longer+ two but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, mankind+ must not separate+. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 19:4-6, Mark 10:8, cf. Genesis 1:27, Genesis 2:24</div> 
<p>

<b>#186</b>&nbsp; Why do you call me good? There is no one good but one who is God. But if you will enter into life, keep the commandments. You shall do no murder. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not bear false witness. Honor your father and your mother. And, you shall love your neighbor as yourself. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 19:17-18, Mark 10:18, Luke 18:19, cf. Exodus 20:12-16, Leviticus 18:5, Leviticus 19:18</div> 
<p>

<b>#189</b>&nbsp; With God all things are possible. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 19:26, cf. Jeremiah 32:17</div> 
<p>

<b>#196</b>&nbsp; Have faith in God. If you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do this to the fig tree, but also if you say to this mountain: Be removed and be cast into the sea, and do not doubt in your heart, but believes that those things that they said shall come to pass, it will be done. All things whatsoever you ask in prayer believing, you will receive. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 21:21-22, Mark 11:22-24</div> 
<p>

<b>#200</b>&nbsp; You err by not knowing the Scriptures or the power of God. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 22:29</div> 
<p>
<b>#201</b>&nbsp; You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength. This is the first and great commandment. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 22:37-38, Mark 12:30, cf. Deuteronomy 6:5</div> 
<p>
<b>#202</b>&nbsp; The second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 19:19, Matthew 22:39-40, Mark 12:31</div> 
<p>

<b>#204</b>&nbsp; Do not be called Rabbi. For one is your Master, Christ. All of you are family+. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 23:8</div> 
<p>
<b>#205</b>&nbsp; Do not call any+ man your father on the earth, for one is your Father, who is in heaven. Neither should you be called masters. For one is your Master, Christ. But one who is greatest among you shall be your servant. <div id="italicText" >Matthew 23:9-11</div> 
<p>
