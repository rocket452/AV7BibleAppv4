<p>
<b>#1</b>&nbsp; I am the Lord your God . . . you shall have no other gods before me. 
<font class=small><i>Exodus 20:2-3</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#2</b>&nbsp; You shall not make any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. You shall not bow down to them nor serve them. For I the Lord your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity~ of the fathers onto the children to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, yet showing mercy to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments. <font class=small><i>Exodus 20:4-6 </i></font>
<p>
<b>#3</b>&nbsp; You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain. For the Lord will not hold those guiltless who take His name in vain. <font class=small><i>Exodus 20:7 </i></font>
<p>
<b>#4</b>&nbsp; Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days shall you labor and do all your work. The seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. In it you shall not do any work, neither you nor your son nor your daughter, your manservant nor your maidservant, your cattle nor your stranger~ who is within your gates. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy+. <font class=small><i>Exodus 20:8-11 </i></font>
<p>
<b>#5</b>&nbsp; Honor your father and your mother so that your days may be long on the land that the Lord your God gives to you. <font class=small><i>Exodus 20:12 </i></font>
<p>
<b>#6</b>&nbsp; You shall not murder+. <font class=small><i>Exodus 20:13 </i></font>
<p>
<b>#7</b>&nbsp; You shall not commit adultery. <font class=small><i>Exodus 20:14 </i></font>
<p>
<b>#8</b>&nbsp; You shall not steal. <font class=small><i>Exodus 20:15 </i></font>
<p>
<b>#9</b>&nbsp; You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor. <font class=small><i>Exodus 20:16 </i></font>
<p>
<b>#10</b>&nbsp; You shall not covet your neighbor's house. You shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is your neighbor's. <font class=small><i>Exodus 20:17 </i></font>
<p>
<b>#11</b>&nbsp; It is written: Mankind+ shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. <font class=small><i>Matthew 4:4, cf. Deuteronomy 8:3 </i></font>
<p>
<b>#12</b>&nbsp; Again it is written: You shall not tempt the Lord your God. <font class=small><i>Matthew 4:7, cf. Deuteronomy 6:16 </i></font>
<p>
<b>#13</b>&nbsp; It is written: You shall worship the Lord your God and Him only shall you serve. <font class=small><i>Matthew 4:10, cf. Exodus 34:14, Deuteronomy 10:20 </i></font>
<p>
<b>#14</b>&nbsp; Unless+ a person+ is born again, they cannot see the kingdom of God. <font class=small><i>John 3:3 </i></font>
<p>
<b>#15</b>&nbsp; Unless+ a person+ is born of water and of the Spirit, they cannot enter into the kingdom of God. <font class=small><i>John 3:5 </i></font>
<p>
<b>#16</b>&nbsp; The wind blows where it will+ and you hear the sound of it, but you cannot tell from where it comes and where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit. <font class=small><i>John 3:8 </i></font>
<p>
<b>#17</b>&nbsp; For God so loved the world, that He gave His Only Begotten Son, so that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal+ life. <font class=small><i>John 3:16 </i></font>
<p>
<b>#18</b>&nbsp; For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but so that the world through Him might be saved. <font class=small><i>John 3:17 </i></font>
<p>
<b>#19</b>&nbsp; And this is the condemnation: That light has come into the world, but people+ have loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. <font class=small><i>John 3:19 </i></font>
<p>
<b>#20</b>&nbsp; But whoever drinks of the water that I give will never thirst. However, the water that I give will become a well of water within+ them springing up into eternal+ life. <font class=small><i>John 4:14 </i></font>
<p>
<b>#21</b>&nbsp; God is Spirit. Those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth. <font class=small><i>John 4:24</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#22</b>&nbsp; Do you not say: There are yet four months and then the harvest time comes? Lift up your eyes and look at the fields, for they are white, ready to harvest. <font class=small><i>John 4:35</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#23</b>&nbsp; Repent. For the kingdom of heaven is very near+. <font class=small><i>Matthew 4:17</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#24</b>&nbsp; Follow me and I will make you fishers~ of men. <font class=small><i>Matthew 4:19</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#25</b>&nbsp; Behold, you are made whole. Sin no more, lest a worse thing come to you. <font class=small><i>John 5:14</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#26</b>&nbsp; Anyone who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who has sent Him. <font class=small><i>John 5:23</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#27</b>&nbsp; Those who hear my Word and believe in Him who sent me have eternal+ life and will not come into condemnation, but are passed from death to life. <font class=small><i>John 5:24</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#28</b>&nbsp; Those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of damnation. <font class=small><i>John 5:29</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#29</b>&nbsp; Search the Scriptures. For in them you think you have eternal life, and they + testify of me. <font class=small><i>John 5:39, cf. Jeremiah 29:13</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#30</b>&nbsp; Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. <font class=small><i>Matthew 5:3</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#31</b>&nbsp; Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted. <font class=small><i>Matthew 5:4</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#32</b>&nbsp; Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. <font class=small><i>Matthew 5:5, cf. Psalm 37:11</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#33</b>&nbsp; Blessed are those who do hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled. <font class=small><i>Matthew 5:6</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#34</b>&nbsp; Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. <font class=small><i>Matthew 5:7, cf. Proverbs 11:17</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#35</b>&nbsp; Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. <font class=small><i>Matthew 5:8</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#36</b>&nbsp; Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God. <font class=small><i>Matthew 5:9</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#37</b>&nbsp; Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. <font class=small><i>Matthew 5:10, cf. Isaiah 8:12</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#38</b>&nbsp; Blessed are you when people revile you and persecute you and say all kinds+ of evil against you falsely for my sake. <font class=small><i>Matthew 5:11</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#39</b>&nbsp; Rejoice and be exceedingly glad. For great is your reward in heaven. For so likewise did they persecute the prophets who were before you. <font class=small><i>Matthew 5:12, cf. 2 Chronicles 36:16</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#40</b>&nbsp; You are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its savor, with what will it be salted? It is thereafter+ good for nothing but to be cast out and trampled+ under foot+. Matthew 5:13</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#41</b>&nbsp; You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid. <font class=small><i>Matthew 5:14</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#42</b>&nbsp; Let your light so shine before people that they may see your good works and glorify~ your Father in heaven. <font class=small><i>Matthew 5:16</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#43</b>&nbsp; Do not think that I have come to destroy the law or the prophets. I have not come to destroy, but to fulfill. <font class=small><i>Matthew 5:17</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#44</b>&nbsp; Whoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments and shall teach people+ to do so shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever shall do them and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. <font class=small><i>Matthew 5:19</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#45</b>&nbsp; Unless+ your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven. <font class=small><i>Matthew 5:20</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#46</b>&nbsp; You have heard that it was said of old+: You shall not kill and whoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment. But I say to you: Whoever is angry with one of the family+ of God without a just cause shall be in danger of the judgment. Whoever says to one of the family+: Raca~, to offend, shall be in danger of the council. But whoever says: You fool, shall be in danger of hell fire. <font class=small><i>Matthew 5:21-22, cf. Exodus 20:13</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#47</b>&nbsp; Therefore if you bring your gift to the altar and there remember that one of your family+ has anything+ against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go first to be reconciled to your family+ and then come and offer your gift. <font class=small><i>Matthew 5:23-24</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#48</b>&nbsp; Agree with your adversary quickly while you are on the way with them, lest at any time the adversary deliver you to the judge and the judge deliver you to the officer and you be cast into prison. <font class=small><i>Matthew 5:25, cf. Proverbs 25:8</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#49</b>&nbsp; You have heard that it was said of old+: You shall not commit adultery. But I say to you that whoever looks upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart. <font class=small><i>Matthew 5:27, cf. Exodus 20:14, Proverbs 6:25</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#50</b>&nbsp; It has been said: Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a written divorce+. But I say to you that whoever shall put away his wife, except+ for the cause of fornication~, causes them+ to commit adultery~. And whoever shall marry one who is thus divorced~ commits adultery. <font class=small><i>Matthew 5:31, cf. Deuteronomy 24:1</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#51</b>&nbsp; Again, you have heard that it was said of old+: You shall not perjure+ yourself but shall perform your oaths to the Lord. But I say to you: Do not swear oaths at all. Not by heaven for it is God's throne nor by the earth for it is His footstool. And not by Jerusalem for it is the city of the great King. Nor shall you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair black or white. But let your communication be simply yes for yes and no for no. For whatever is more than these comes of evil. <font class=small><i>Matthew 5:33-37, cf. Numbers 30:2</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#52</b>&nbsp; You have heard that it has been said: An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. But I say to you: Do not retaliate+ against evil, but whoever shall strike+ you on your right cheek, turn to them the other also. <font class=small><i>Matthew 5:38-39, cf. Exodus 21:24, Proverbs 24:29</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#53</b>&nbsp; You have heard that it has been said: You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy. But I say to you: Love your enemies. Bless those who curse you. Do good to those who hate you. And pray for those who despitefully use you and persecute you so that you may be the children of your Father in heaven. For He makes His sun to rise on the evil and on the good and He sends rain on the righteous+ and on the unrighteous+. <font class=small><i>Matthew 5:43-45, cf. Leviticus 19:18, Proverbs 16:7</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#54</b>&nbsp; Take heed that you do not give your alms~ before people+ to be seen by them. Otherwise you will have no reward from your Father in heaven. <font class=small><i>Matthew 6:1</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#55</b>&nbsp; When you pray, do not be as the hypocrites are. For they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets so that they may be seen by people+. They have their reward. <font class=small><i>Matthew 6:5</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#56</b>&nbsp; When you pray, do not use vain repetitions as the heathen do, for they think that they will be heard for their much speaking. <font class=small><i>Matthew 6:7</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#57</b>&nbsp; Therefore pray in this manner: Our Father in heaven, Holy+ is your name. <font class=small><i>Matthew 6:9</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#58</b>&nbsp; For if you forgive others for their trespasses~ then your heavenly Father will also forgive you. <font class=small><i>Matthew 6:14</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#59</b>&nbsp; Who among+ you shall have a friend and shall go to him at midnight and say to him: Friend, lend me three loaves. Though he will not arise and give anything to him because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence+ he will rise and give him all+ he needs. <font class=small><i>Luke 11:5,8</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#60</b>&nbsp; Moreover when you fast, do not be like the hypocrites of a sad countenance. For they disfigure their faces so that they will appear to people+ to fast. They have their reward. <font class=small><i>Matthew 6:16</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#61</b>&nbsp; Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust corrupt~ and where thieves break through and steal. <font class=small><i>Matthew 6:19</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#62</b>&nbsp; Do not be afraid, little flock. For it is your Father's good pleasure to give the kingdom of God to you. <font class=small><i>Luke 12:32</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#63</b>&nbsp; Sell what you have~ and give alms~. Make+ provision bags for yourselves that will not grow+ old, a treasure in the heavens that will not fail, where no thief approaches nor moth corrupts. <font class=small><i>Luke 12:33</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#64</b>&nbsp; The light of the body is the eye. Therefore if your eye is single~ then your whole body will be full of light. <font class=small><i>Matthew 6:22</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#65</b>&nbsp; No one can serve two masters. For either they will hate the one and love the other, or else they will hold to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and worldly treasures+. <font class=small><i>Matthew 6:24</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#66</b>&nbsp; Take heed and beware of covetousness. For one's life is not to be found in the abundance of things one possesses. <font class=small><i>Luke 12:15</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#67</b>&nbsp; The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully. He thought within himself saying: What shall I do, because I have no room to store+ all my fruits? Then he said: This is what I will do: I will pull down my barns and build larger+ ones, and there I will store+ all my fruits and my possessions+. I will say to my soul: Soul, you have many goods stored+ up for many years. Now take your ease: Eat, drink, and be merry. But God said to him: You fool. This night your soul will be required of you. Then whose shall those things be that you have prepared+ for yourself? So it is with those who lay up treasure for themselves and are not rich toward God. <font class=small><i>Luke 12:16-21, cf. Proverbs 27:1</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#68</b>&nbsp; Take no thought for your life, what you will eat or what you will drink. Nor for your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food+ and the body more than clothing+? <font class=small><i>Matthew 6:25</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#69</b>&nbsp; Behold the birds+ of the air, for they do not sow nor do they reap or gather into barns. Yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much better than they? <font class=small><i>Matthew 6:26</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#70</b>&nbsp; Who among+ you by taking thought can add one cubit to your stature? <font class=small><i>Matthew 6:27</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#71</b>&nbsp; Why do you take thought for clothing+? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow. They do not toil nor do they spin. <font class=small><i>Matthew 6:28</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#72</b>&nbsp; Therefore take no thought saying: What shall we eat? Or what shall we drink? Or how will we be clothed? <font class=small><i>Matthew 6:31</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#73</b>&nbsp; Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things will be added to you. <font class=small><i>Matthew 6:33</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#74</b>&nbsp; Take no thought for tomorrow, for tomorrow will take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient to the day is the evil thereof. <font class=small><i>Matthew 6:34</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#75</b>&nbsp; Do not judge so that you will not be judged. <font class=small><i>Matthew 7:1</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#76</b>&nbsp; Give and it will be given to you: Good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, others+ will give to your innermost+ needs. For with the same gauge+ with which you measure+ it will be measured to you again. <font class=small><i>Luke 6:38</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#77</b>&nbsp; Can the blind lead the blind? Will they not both fall into the ditch? <font class=small><i>Luke 6:39</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#78</b>&nbsp; Why do you notice+ the speck+ that is in your brother's or sister's eye, but do not consider~ the beam~ that is in your own eye? <font class=small><i>Matthew 7:3</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#79</b>&nbsp; Do not give what is holy to the dogs or cast your pearls before swine lest they trample them under their feet and turn again and tear+ you. <font class=small><i>Matthew 7:6</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#80</b>&nbsp; Ask and it will be given to you. Seek and you will find. Knock and it will be opened to you. <font class=small><i>Matthew 7:7</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#81</b>&nbsp; Or who is there among you, if your son asks for bread will give him a stone? <font class=small><i>Matthew 7:9</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#82</b>&nbsp; Therefore all things whatsoever you would that others should do to you, you do to them. For this is the sum of the law and the prophets. <font class=small><i>Matthew 7:12</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#83</b>&nbsp; Enter in at the strait gate, for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction and there are many who go in that way+ <font class=small><i>Matthew 7:13</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#84</b>&nbsp; Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are greedy+ wolves. <font class=small><i>Matthew 7:15</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#85</b>&nbsp; You will know them by their fruits. Do people+ gather grapes from thorns or figs from thistles? <font class=small><i>Matthew 7:16, cf. Proverbs 20:11</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#86</b>&nbsp; Not everyone who says to me: Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of heaven, but only those who do the will of my Father in heaven. <font class=small><i>Matthew 7:21</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#87</b>&nbsp; Why do you call me: Lord, Lord, and do not do the things that I say? <font class=small><i>Luke 6:46</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#88</b>&nbsp; No one, having put their hand to the plow and then looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God. <font class=small><i>Luke 9:62</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#89</b>&nbsp; Why are you fearful, O you of little faith? Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea and there came a great calm. <font class=small><i>Matthew 8:26</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#90</b>&nbsp; Why do you think evil in your hearts? <font class=small><i>Matthew 9:4</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#91</b>&nbsp; Go and learn what this means: I will have mercy and not sacrifice. For I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance. <font class=small><i>Matthew 9:13, cf. Hosea 6:6</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#92</b>&nbsp; Do not be afraid. Only believe. <font class=small><i>Mark 5:36</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#93</b>&nbsp; According to your faith be it to you. <font class=small><i>Matthew 9:29</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#94</b>&nbsp; The harvest truly is plentiful, but the laborers are few. <font class=small><i>Matthew 9:37</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#95</b>&nbsp; The kingdom of heaven is very near+. <font class=small><i>Matthew 10:7</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#96</b>&nbsp; Heal the sick. Cleanse the lepers. Raise the dead. Cast out demons+. Freely you have received, freely give. <font class=small><i>Matthew 10:8</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#97</b>&nbsp; Provide neither gold nor silver nor brass in your purses. <font class=small><i>Matthew 10:9</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#98</b>&nbsp; Into whatever city or town you enter, inquire who in it is worthy and stay+ there until you go on from there+. <font class=small><i>Matthew 10:11</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#99</b>&nbsp; When you come into a house, greet+ it. <font class=small><i>Matthew 10:12</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#100</b>&nbsp; Whoever will not receive you or hear your words, when you depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet. <font class=small><i>Matthew 10:14</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#101</b>&nbsp; Those who hear you, hear me. Those who despise you, despise me. Those who despise me, despise Him who sent me. <font class=small><i>Luke 10:16</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#102</b>&nbsp; Behold I send you forth like sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be as wise as serpents and as harmless as doves. <font class=small><i>Matthew 10:16</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#103</b>&nbsp; Behold I give you authority+ and power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy. Nothing shall by any means hurt you. <font class=small><i>Luke 10:19</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#104</b>&nbsp; Even so, do not rejoice that the spirits are subject to you, but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven. <font class=small><i>Luke 10:20</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#105</b>&nbsp; But beware of people+, for they will deliver you up to the councils and they will flog+ you in their synagogues. <font class=small><i>Matthew 10:17</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#106</b>&nbsp; Therefore do not be afraid of them, for there is nothing covered that will not be revealed and nothing hid that will not be known. <font class=small><i>Matthew 10:26</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#107</b>&nbsp; Do not fear those who kill the body but are not able to kill the soul. Instead+, fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. <font class=small><i>Matthew 10:28</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#108</b>&nbsp; Are not two sparrows sold for a penny+? And not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father knowing it. <font class=small><i>Matthew 10:29</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#109</b>&nbsp; Whoever therefore will confess me before people+, I will confess also before my Father in heaven. <font class=small><i>Matthew 10:32</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#110</b>&nbsp; Those who love father or mother more than me are not worthy of me. Those who love son or daughter more than me are not worthy of me. <font class=small><i>Matthew 10:37</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#111</b>&nbsp; Those who receive you receive me and those who receive me receive Him who sent me. <font class=small><i>Matthew 10:40</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#112</b>&nbsp; The blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the Gospel proclaimed+ to them. <font class=small><i>Matthew 11:5, cf. Isaiah 35:5</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#113</b>&nbsp; Those who have ears to hear, let them hear. <font class=small><i>Matthew 11:15</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#114</b>&nbsp; Come to me all you who labor and are heavily burdened+ and I will give you rest. <font class=small><i>Matthew 11:28, cf. Jeremiah 31:25</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#115</b>&nbsp; You are overly anxious+ and troubled about so many things. But one thing is necessary+ and Mary has chosen that good part and that will not be taken from her. <font class=small><i>Luke 10:41-42</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#116</b>&nbsp; There was a certain creditor who had two debtors. One owed nearly two year's wages+ and the other two month's wages+. When they had nothing with which to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore: Which of them will love him most? Simon answered and said: I suppose that the one to whom he forgave most. You have judged correctly+. <font class=small><i>Luke 7-41-43</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#117</b>&nbsp; But if you had known what this means: I will have mercy and not sacrifice, you would not have condemned the innocent+. <font class=small><i>Matthew 12:7, cf. Hosea 6:6</i></font>

<b>#126</b>&nbsp; Behold a sower went forth to sow. When he sowed, some fell by the wayside and the birds+ came and devoured them up. Some fell on stony places where they did not have much earth. Immediately+ they sprang up because they had no depth of earth, and when the sun was up, they were scorched, and because they had no root, they withered away.

<b>#128</b>&nbsp; I in parables, because seeing they do not see and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand.

Their ears are dull of hearing and they have closed their eyes, lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their hearts and should be converted, and I should heal them. But blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear. Many prophets and righteous people have desired to see what you see but have not seen it and to hear what you hear but have not heard it. <font class=small><i>Matthew 13:13, cf.

<b>#129</b>&nbsp; Hear the parable of the sower: When anyone hears the Word of the kingdom and does not understand it, then the wicked one comes and catches away what was sown in their heart.

Yet they have no root in themselves and therefore they endure only for a while. For when tribulation or persecution arises because of the Word, immediately+ they are offended and disbelieve. And the one who received seed among the thorns is like those who hear the Word but the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the Word and they become unfruitful.

<b>#155</b>&nbsp; The kingdom of heaven may be compared+ to a certain king who wanted to take account of his servants.

His fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged+ Him saying: Have patience with me and I will pay you all. He would not, but went and cast him into prison until he should pay the debt. So when his fellow servants saw what was done, they were very sorry and came and told their lord~ all that was done. 
<p>
Then his lord~, after he had called him, said to him: O you wicked servant. I forgave you all that debt because you begged+ me. Should you not also have had compassion on your fellow servant even as I had pity on you? And his lord~ was angry+ and delivered him to the torturers+ until he should pay all that was due to him. So likewise will my heavenly Father do also to you if you do not, from your hearts, forgive everyone of the family+ of God for their trespasses~. If one trespasses~ against you seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to you saying: I repent, you shall forgive them. <font class=small><i>Matthew 18:23-35</i></font>

<b>#170</b>&nbsp; A certain man had two sons. The younger said to his father: Father, give me the portion of your property+ that will fall to me.

After he had spent everything+ he had, a mighty famine arose in that land and he began to be in want. So, he joined a citizen of that country who sent him into his fields to feed swine. The foolish son would gladly+ have filled his belly with the husks that the swine ate but no one gave him any. When he came to himself, he said: How many of my father's hired servants have bread enough and to spare, and I am perishing with hunger. I will arise and go to my father and will say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer+ worthy to be called your son. Make me as one of your hired servants.

Therefore his father came out and pleaded+ with him. But he said to his father: Behold, these many years I have served you and not at any time transgressed your commandment. Yet you never gave me a young goat so that I might make merry with my friends. But now, when this son of yours has come, one who has devoured your livelihood+ with harlots, you have killed the fatted calf for him. The father said to him: Son, you are always+ with me and all that I have is yours. It was fitting+ that we should make merry and be glad, for this your brother was dead and now is alive again.

So he called everyone of his lord's debtors and said to the first: How much do you owe to my lord~? He said: A hundred measures of oil. The steward said to him: Take your bill and quickly write fifty. Then he said to another: How much do you owe? He said: A hundred measures of wheat.

<b>#194</b>&nbsp; If anyone will serve me, let them follow me, and where I am, my servant will be there also. If anyone will serve me, my Father will honor them. <font class=small><i>John 12:26</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#195</b>&nbsp; Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk in the light while you have the light, lest darkness come upon you. For those who walk in darkness do not know where they are going. While you have light, believe in the light so that you may be the children of light. <font class=small><i>John 12:35-36, cf. Proverbs 4:19</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#196</b>&nbsp; Have faith in God. If you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do this to the fig tree, but also if you say to this mountain: Be removed and be cast into the sea, and do not doubt in your heart, but believes that those things that they said shall come to pass, it will be done. All things whatsoever you ask in prayer believing, you will receive. <font class=small><i>Matthew 21:21-22, Mark 11:22-24</i></font>

<b>#197</b>&nbsp; A certain man had two sons. He came to the first and said: Son, go work today in my vineyard. The son answered and said: I will not, but afterward he repented and went. He came to the second and said likewise. And the second son answered and said: I will go sir, but he did not go. <font class=small><i>Matthew 21:28-30</i></font>

<p>
<b>#201</b>&nbsp; You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength. This is the first and great commandment. <font class=small><i>Matthew 22:37-38, Mark 12:30, cf. Deuteronomy 6:5</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#202</b>&nbsp; The second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets. <font class=small><i>Matthew 19:19, Matthew 22:39-40, Mark 12:31</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#203</b>&nbsp; A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among thieves who stripped him of his clothing+, wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead. About the same time a certain priest came down that way, and when he saw the injured man, he passed by on the other side. Likewise a Levite came by the same place, looked at the injured man, and passed by on the other side. But then a certain Samaritan, as he was traveling+ by, saw the injured man, had compassion on him, went to him, bound up his wounds, poured soothing oil on him, gave him wine, set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn and took care of him. 
<p>
On the next day when he departed, the Samaritan took out two coins+ and gave them to the host and said to him: Take care of him. Whatever more you spend, I will repay you when I come again. Which now of these three do you think, was a good neighbor to the one who fell among the thieves? The lawyer said: He who showed mercy on him. Go and do likewise. <font class=small><i>Luke 10:30-37</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#204</b>&nbsp; Do not be called Rabbi. For one is your Master, Christ. All of you are family+. <font class=small><i>Matthew 23:8</i></font>

<b>#213</b>&nbsp; Take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overburdened+ with excesses+ and drunkenness and the cares of this life so that judgment day comes upon you unexpectedly+. <font class=small><i>Luke 21:34</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#214</b>&nbsp; Watch, for you do not know at what hour your Lord, the master~ of the house, is coming+: In the evening+, at midnight, at the cock crowing, or in the morning. <font class=small><i>Matthew 24:42, Mark 13:35</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#215</b>&nbsp; Who then is a faithful and wise servant whom his lord~ has set+ over his household to give them food+ in due season? Blessed is that servant whom his lord~ will find doing as instructed when he comes. He will set+ that servant over all his goods. <font class=small><i>Matthew 24:45-47</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#216</b>&nbsp; The kingdom of heaven shall be compared+ to ten virgins who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were wise and five were foolish. Those who were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them. But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept. At midnight there was a cry: Behold the Bridegroom is coming+. Go out to meet Him. Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps. The foolish said to the wise: Give us some of your oil for our lamps have gone out. But the wise answered saying: No. Lest there not be enough for us and you. But rather go to those who sell and buy for yourselves. 
<p>
While they went to buy, the Bridegroom came. Those who were ready went in with Him to the marriage and the door was shut. Afterward the other virgins also came saying: Lord, Lord, open to us. But He answered and said: I do not know you. Watch, therefore. For you do not know either the day or the hour in which the Son of man is coming. <font class=small><i>Matthew 25:1-13</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#217</b>&nbsp; The kingdom of heaven is like+ a man traveling to a far country who called his servants and gave+ his goods to them. To one he gave five talents. To another two. And to another one. To everyone+ according to their several abilities. And then he immediately+ took his journey. The one who had received the five talents traded with the same and earned+ another five talents. Likewise the one who had received two also gained another two. But the one who had received one talent dug in the earth and hid the lord's money.
<p>
After a long time, the lord~ of those servants came and examined+ their accounts with them. The one who had received five talents brought another+ five talents saying: Lord, you delivered to me five talents. Behold I have gained five talents more. His lord~ said to him: Well done good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set+ you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord. Likewise, the one who had received two talents said: Lord, you delivered to me two talents. Behold I have gained two more talents. His lord~ said to him: Well done good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set+ you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.
<p>
Then the one who had received one talent said: Lord, I knew that you are a hard man, reaping where you have not sown and gathering where you have not spread+. I was afraid and hid your talent in the earth. There you have what is yours. The lord~ answered and said: You wicked and lazy+ servant. You knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I have not spread+. Therefore you should have put my money with the bankers+ and then at my coming I should have received my own with interest+. Therefore take the talent from the lazy+ servant and give it to the one who has ten talents. <font class=small><i>Matthew 25:14-28</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#218</b>&nbsp; To everyone who has will more be given and they will have abundance. But from those who have nothing, even what they have will be taken away. <font class=small><i>Matthew 25:29</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#219</b>&nbsp; Cast the unprofitable~ servant into outer darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. <font class=small><i>Matthew 25:30</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#220</b>&nbsp; Then the King will say to those at His right hand: Come, you blessed by my Father. Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry and you gave me food+. I was thirsty and you gave me drink. I was a stranger, and you took me in. I was naked and you clothed me. I was sick and you visited me. I was in prison and you came to me. Then the righteous will answer Him saying: Lord, when did we see you hungry and fed you? Or thirsty and gave you drink? When did we see you a stranger and took you in? Or naked and clothed you? Or when did we see you sick or in prison and came to you? The King will answer and say to them: Inasmuch as you have done it to one of the least of these my brothers, you have done it to me. 
<p>
Then He will also say to them on the left hand: Depart from me you cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me no food+. I was thirsty and you gave me no drink. I was a stranger and you did not take me in. Naked and you did not cloth me. Sick and in prison and you did not visit me. Then they will also answer Him saying: Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister to you? Then He will answer them saying: Inasmuch as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me. Therefore these shall go away into everlasting punishment. But the righteous into eternal life. <font class=small><i>Matthew 25:34-46, cf. Daniel 12:2, Isaiah 58:7, Proverbs 19:17</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#221</b>&nbsp; I have given you an example so that you should do as I have done to you. The servant is not greater than his lord~. Nor are those who are sent greater than one who sent them. If you know these things, blessed+ are you if you do them. <font class=small><i>John 13:15-17</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#222</b>&nbsp; Those who receive whomever I send receive me and those who receive me receive Him who sent me. <font class=small><i>John 13:20</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#223</b>&nbsp; A new commandment I give to you: That you love one another. As I have loved you, that you also love one another. By this all people will know that you are my disciples: If you have love toward one another. <font class=small><i>John 13:34-35</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#224</b>&nbsp; I have prayed for you, that your faith not fail. When you are converted, strengthen~ the family+ of God. <font class=small><i>Luke 22:32</i></font>

<b>#225</b>&nbsp; Do not let your heart be troubled. You believe in God. Believe also in me. <font class=small><i>John 14:1</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#226</b>&nbsp; I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father, but by me. <font class=small><i>John 14:6</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#227</b>&nbsp; Those who believe in me will also do the works that I do, and greater works than these will they do because I go to my Father. <font class=small><i>John 14:12</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#228</b>&nbsp; Whatever you ask in my name, that I will do so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask anything in my name, I will do it. <font class=small><i>John 14:13-14</i></font>
<p>
<b>#229</b>&nbsp; If you love me, keep~ my commandments. <font class=small><i>John 14:15</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#230</b>&nbsp; Those who have my commandments and keep them + are the ones who truly love me. Those who love me will be loved by my Father and I will love them and will reveal+ myself to them. If anyone+ loves me, they will keep my words and my Father will love them and we will come to them and live+ within them. <font class=small><i>John 14:21-23, cf. Proverbs 8:17</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#231</b>&nbsp; Those who do not love me do not keep my Word+. The Word that you hear is not mine, but the Father's who sent me. <font class=small><i>John 14:24</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#232</b>&nbsp; Peace I leave with you. My peace I give to you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your heart be troubled and do not let it be afraid. <font class=small><i>John 14:27</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#233</b>&nbsp; I am the true vine and my Father is the grower+. Every branch in me that does not bear fruit He takes away. Every branch that bears fruit, He purges so that it may bring forth more fruit. Now you are clean through the Word that I have spoken to you. Abide~ in me and I will abide in you. Because+ the branch cannot bear fruit by+ itself unless+ it remains+ in the vine. Nor+ can you, unless+ you abide~ in me. I am the vine. You are the branches. Those who stay+ and abide in me and I in them bring forth much fruit. Without me you can do nothing. 
<p>
If anyone+ does not stay+ and abide in me, they will be cast out+ like+ a broken and withered branch, and these are gathered and thrown+ into a fire and burned. If you abide~ in me and my words abide in you, then you shall ask whatever+ you will and it will be done for you. Herein is my Father glorified: That you become+ my disciples and bear much fruit. As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Now continue to abide+ in my love. <font class=small><i>John 15:1-9</i></font>

<b>#237</b>&nbsp; Greater love has no one than this, that one+ lay down one's own life for one's friends. <font class=small><i>John 15:13</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#238</b>&nbsp; You are my friends if you do whatever I command you. Henceforth I will not call you servants, for the servant does not understand what his lord~ does. But I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard from+ my Father I have made known to you. You have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you so that you should go and bring forth fruit and so that your fruit should remain and so that whatever you ask of the Father in my name, He may give it to you. These things I command you: That you love one another. <font class=small><i>John 15:14-17</i></font>

<b>#239</b>&nbsp; If the world hates you, know that it hated me before it hated you. <font class=small><i>John 15:18</i></font>

<b>#240</b>&nbsp; When the Spirit of Truth has come, He will guide you into all truth. For He will not speak from+ Himself, but whatever He hears from God He will speak, and He will show you things to come. <font class=small><i>John 16:13</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#241</b>&nbsp; Before this+, you have asked nothing in my name. Now ask and you shall receive so that your joy may be full. <font class=small><i>John 16:24</i></font> 
<p>
<b>#242</b>&nbsp; I have spoken these things to you so that in me you might have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But be of good cheer~. I have overcome the world. <font class=small><i>John 16:33</i></font>
