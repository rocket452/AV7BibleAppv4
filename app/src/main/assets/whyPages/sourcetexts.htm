				 <b>Question:</b>&nbsp; Why does it matter which Greek and Hebrew source texts are used to translate the Bible? And which does AV7 use?  
				<p>
				<b>Answer:</b>&nbsp; AV7 follows the Textus Receptus Greek text for the New Testament 
				and the Masoretic Hebrew source text for the Old Testament.
				<p>
				Consider for a moment, the history of how the Bible came into existence. 
				Prior to the year 1881 A.D., most efforts surrounding development of the Bible 
				were focused on endeavoring to collect and aggregate the most reliable original 
				language texts possible, and striving to make the most accurate wordfor-word 
				translation in the common languages that people used in their day-to-day lives. 
				<p>
				However, after 1881, Bible publishing became somewhat convoluted. Before 1881, 
				there were only relatively minor differences in thousands of copies of original 
				language source texts ... and few significant differences in translations. 
				<p>
				After 1881, a strange thing happened. Certain individuals found some old 
				original language texts that had been put away in storage, unused for a thousand 
				years. But since those texts were thought to be older than original language texts 
				that had been preserved, copied, and recopied for a thousand years, the individuals 
				who found those older texts speculated that simply because those old discarded 
				texts were thought to be older, then surely they must be more authentic and better.
				<p>
				The regrettable result of this speculation was that after 1881, two competing 
				schools of thought developed:
				<p>
				1) There continued to those who believe that God has always providentially 
				preserved the most trustworthy original language source texts throughout 
				all of recorded history. 
				<p>
				2) But now there was a "new" theory that God did not preserve the most trustworthy 
				original language texts of His Word ... until some ancient texts that had been put 
				away, unused, disregarded, and essentially discarded for a thousand years were 
				found in the 1800s A.D.
				<p>
				Consequently, in 1881, some of those who claimed that those recently found,
				supposedly older source texts were superior, then published a new and different 
				Greek text and a new "revised" English translation based on those supposedly 
				older source texts ... thereby seeking to cast doubt on the trustworthiness of 
				the great Bible that most people had come to love and trust by questioning 
				the veracity of the long prevailing original source language texts.
				<p>
				This, therefore, was the beginning of what eventually became a near avalanche 
				of new and different so-called modern translations. And the debate over which 
				original language source texts are the most viable has become an endless 
				continuing debate. 
				<p>
				Basically, this debate boils down to this one single consideration: 
				<p>
				Should we believe that Almighty God has, in fact, been capable of preserving 
				the most trustworthy original language source texts of the Word of God and 
				accompanying Scriptures throughout history? 
				<p>
				Or should we believe that Almighty God was not, in fact, able to do that, 
				and that the most valid and trustworthy original language source texts were 
				lost for many hundreds if not a thousand years until they were eventually 
				discovered among discarded old manuscripts in the 1800s and brought to light 
				to form a new and supposedly "improved" basis for the Bible.
