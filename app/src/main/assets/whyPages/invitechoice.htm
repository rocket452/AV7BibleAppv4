				<b>Question:</b>&nbsp; Why does the AV7 Cordial Invitation indicate 
				that to join God's family is a choice?&nbsp; Doesn't that concept 
				conflict with the doctrine of predestination? 
				<p>

				<b>Answer:</b>&nbsp; The doctrine of predestination is a belief that everyone is predestined 
				by God to either be "saved to Heaven" or to be "lost and condemned to Hell" 
				for all eternity before they are born.&nbsp; That point of view comes 
				from a system of belief called "Calvinism."
				<p>
				One alternate point of view called "Arminianism" holds that every 
				human being has a "free will" choice to either accept God's offer of 
				eternal life or to reject it.&nbsp; Following is a brief explanation 
				of each of these opposing points of view: 
				<p> 
				Armenianism declares that salvation is accomplished only by God 
				who takes the initiative to draw every person to Himself and that 
				Jesus' atoning death and resurrection were for every living human 
				being to have the opportunity to receive salvation.&nbsp; However, 
				each individual person must choose to either accept the free gift of 
				salvation that God has offered, or reject His offer.&nbsp; God alone 
				makes salvation possible, and He makes salvation available to everyone.
				<p>
				There is nothing that anyone can do to earn salvation.&nbsp; It is 
				given by God's grace alone, and it is never attained by good works 
				that anyone does.
				<p>
				However, God's provision of salvation is consumated only when 
				individuals exercise their free will to choose to accept God's offer 
				of grace. 
				<p> 
				Calvinism declares that salvation is accomplished by God alone, 
				but Calvinism asserts that God has <u>predestined</u> every individual 
				to be either saved or be condemned for all eternity from before each 
				person was even born.&nbsp; And Calvinism argues that there is no such 
				thing as "free will." 
				<p>
				Calvinism claims that God has chosen certain people to be saved from 
				before the world was created and Jesus' death and resurrection were 
				provided <u><i>only</i></u> for those predestinated few to be saved.
				<p>
				The Holy Spirit makes Christ's death effective by bringing those 
				"elect" (chosen few) to faith and repentance; thereby causing them 
				to willingly obey the gospel.&nbsp; The entire process, called 
				election, redemption, and regeneration, is the work of God alone 
				and by grace alone, and there is nothing that any individual who was 
				chosen (predestined by God) to be saved can do to lose that salvation.
				<p>
				Calvinism also asserts that there is nothing that anyone who was 
				chosen (predestined by God) to <u>not</u> be saved but to be condemned,
				can do to attain God's gift of grace if they were not predestined 
				to receive it from before they were born.
