			<b>Question:</b>&nbsp; Why is this presentation of the Bible called "AV7 ~ The Invitation Bible"? What does AV7 represent? 
			<p>
			<b>Answer:</b>&nbsp; "AV7" is an acronym that serves as an abbreviated title for "The New Authorized Version of the Bible in Present-Day English."
			<p>
			The first two letters, "AV" stand for Authorized Version, 
			and the "7" represents the seven levels of computer processing used 
			to generate this literally accurate, word-for-word translation 
			from the original Greek language into English; and then to refine 
			the resulting text into an easy-to-read present day English syntax while
			carefully preserving word-for-word translation accuracy.
			<p> 
			<!-- 
			To see a brief description of how the AV7 text was compiled: &nbsp; 
			<a href=../../pdfs/howcomp.pdf><u><font color=blue>
			Click this link</u>.</font></a> -->
			<p>
			Who "authorized" The AV7 Bible so that the title "New Authorized Version" 
			is appropriate? What is the basis for claiming that AV7 is an "authorized" 
			version?
			<p> 
			The AV7 Bible is "authorized" in two ways: 
			<p> 
			First, AV7 closely corresponds to the time-honored English text 
			of the Bible that acquired the title "Authorized Version" by 
			acclaim,&nbsp; even though it was never actually "authorized" by any
			official individual, group, or organizational authority.&nbsp; 
			Nevertheless, since AV7 is a presentation of the Bible that closely 
			corresponds to that long-established and highly acclaimed English 
			text,&nbsp; the title "<i>New</i> Authorized Version" is entirely 
			appropriate and applicable. 
			<p>
			It is important to note that the most trustworthy English language 
			translation of the Bible evolved through many, many revisions,&nbsp;
			corrections,&nbsp; and much "fine-tuning" over many hundreds of 
			years,&nbsp; yet it always preserved continuity throughout. 
			<p>
			Second, the AV7 copyright is administered by "The New Authorized
			Version Foundation,"&nbsp; a non-profit organization dedicated to 
			preserving literal translation accuracy.&nbsp; As the copyright 
			holder for AV7,&nbsp; the New Authorized Version Foundation has 
			declared that The AV7 Bible is <u>authorized</u> to be freely 
			copied for any non-commercial purpose. 
			<p>
			As of the  date of the first printed publication of &nbsp;The 
			AV7 Bible&nbsp; in 2006,&nbsp; no other previous or subsequent 
			version of the Bible had been found to have used a copyright notice 
			that explicitly stipulated authorization for its text to be freely 
			copied,&nbsp; without restrictions,&nbsp; for any non-commercial purpose. 
			<p>
			On the contrary,&nbsp; most if not all commercially promoted 
			English language versions and paraphrases of the Bible ever 
			published have displayed a copyright notice that stipulates 
			&nbsp;"All Rights Reserved,"&nbsp; thereby making the somewhat 
			questionable assertion that the publishers and copyright holders 
			of those version claim to have exclusive proprietary ownership 
			of &nbsp;"<u>their</u>"&nbsp; unique versions of the Bible.&nbsp; 
			<p>
			In distinct contrast to that dubious claim,&nbsp; the copyright 
			notice for&nbsp; The AV7 Bible ~ The New Authorized Version 
			in Present-day English&nbsp; clearly states:
			<p><center>
			"Only commercial rights are reserved.<br>
			All others may freely copy." </center>
