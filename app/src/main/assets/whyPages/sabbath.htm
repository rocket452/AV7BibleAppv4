			<b>Question:</b>&nbsp; Why does the man-made "Sun-day
			Law" counterfeit and wrongly displace God's Sabbath commandment? 
			<p>
			<b>Answer:</b>&nbsp; The Ten Commandments are the foundation of all truth.&nbsp; 
			It is impossible to comprehend why any God-honoring person would ever 
			argue that any of God's Ten Commandments might be omitted or ignored. 
			<p>
			It seems very strange, therefore, that some people who claim to believe in God, and who claim to believe that the Bible is true, would have the audacity to suggest that God did not mean what He said when He declared the fourth Commandment. 
			<p>
			Because, the fourth commandment very clearly commands: "Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy ... the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God.&nbsp; In it you shall not do any work."
			<p>
			The undermining of God's Sabbath Commandment began in 321 A.D., when the Roman Emperor Constantine issued an edict that made sun-day the mandated day of rest and worship to replace God's Sabbath Commandment. 
			<p>
			In ancient times, the sun was venerated and worshipped by pagans because of their belief that light and heat came from the sun.
			<p>
			Socrates records that public worship had been held in Constantinople on both the Sabbath and sun-day.&nbsp; However, Constantine's edict in A.D. 321 mandated that all courts of justice, inhahitants of towns, and workshops, were to be at rest on sun-day (venerabili die Solis).
			<p>
			Then, in 363 A.D., the Council of Laodicea forbad Christians from "Judaizing" and resting on the Sabbath day.&nbsp; Thus, the first law, either ecclesiastical or civil, to mandate "sabbatical observance" on sun-day, was ordained in the sabbatical edict of Constantine.
			<p>
			Eusebius, a fourth-century Catholic bishop and friend of the Emperor Constantine, was the first to record this declaration: "All things whatsoever that was a duty to do on the Sabbath, has transferred to the sun-day." 
			<p>
			Thus, it is clear that to refer to the pagan "sun-day" as the 'Christian Sabbath' is a man-made fabrication that has nothing to do with biblical truth, because 'sun-day' is unquestionably of pagan origin. 
			<p>
			The mandated sun-day day of rest came to pass by Constantine's edict that required abstinence from work.&nbsp; It read as follows: Let all judges and people of the town rest and all the various trades be suspended on the venerable day of the sun. 
			<p>
			Constantine was a sun-worshipper, and thus it is clear that his "sun-day law" never had anything to do with Christianity from the time of its institution.&nbsp; In fact, Constantine's edict was a purely political action
			<p>
			Psalm 118:24 declares: "This is the day that the Lord has made.&nbsp; We will rejoice and be glad in it."&nbsp; It is important to understand, however, that this verse has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the man-made "sun-day" law.
