			<b>Question:</b>&nbsp; How many errors have been reported and corrected
			since the first printing of The AV7 Bible in 2006? 
			<p>

			<b>Answer:</b> &nbsp; Four. 
			<br><br>
			The New Authorized Version Foundation welcomes reports of 
			any and all errors,&nbsp; no matter how small;&nbsp; 
			and we are happy to acknowledge and publish each and every 
			reported error and the corrections made: 
			<ol>
			<li> John 2:20:&nbsp; "<font color=#999><i>claim that</i></font>&nbsp; you can" 
				corrected to:&nbsp; "<font color=#999><i>claim that you can</i></font>"  <!-- 0604-18 -->
			<p>
			<li> Revelation 11:12:&nbsp; "Then they all they heard" 
				 corrected to:&nbsp; "Then they <font color=#999><i>all</i></font> heard"  <!-- 0604-09 -->
			<p>
			<li> Proverbs 22:24:&nbsp; "Do not make make a friendship" 
				 corrected to:&nbsp; "Do not make a friendship" 
			<p>
			<li> On page 317:&nbsp; William Wycliffe in 1385 corrected to:&nbsp; 
				 John Wycliffe in 1382 <!-- 0604-03 -->
			</ol>

			<b>Please note</b>:&nbsp; Many significant errors have been widely reported 
			and publicized in various commercially promoted versions of the Bible.&nbsp; 
			Some of these errors have been revised in subsequent printings;&nbsp; 
			however, with no public acknowledgment of either the errors or of changes 
			that have been made. 
			<p>
			Still, many significant errors remain uncorrected.&nbsp;
			<p>
			Please refer to the "Compare Bibles" information presented at The AV7 Bible 
			website to examine and consider some examples of many significant errors that 
			remain uncorrected in various proprietary versions of the Bible. 
			<p>
			As just one example,&nbsp; More than one commercially promoted proprietary 
			version of the Bible published the following seriously erroneous translation 
			of Luke 21:19:
			<p><center>
			"By standing firm, you can save yourself."</center>
			<p>
			This error continued to be published for more than 10 years, even though it 
			is obvious beyond any question that no human being can ever save themselves. 
			<p>
			Ironically, even after one publisher of this error made a change, their 
			subsequently revised paraphrase remains a misleading distortion, and not 
			at all consistent with or representative of the word-for-word-accurate 
			translation of this verse, which is:
			<p><center>
			"In your patience, possess your souls."</center>
