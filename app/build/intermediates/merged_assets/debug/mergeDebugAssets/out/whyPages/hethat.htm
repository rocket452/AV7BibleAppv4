			<b>Question:</b>&nbsp; Why does The AV7 Bible use the wording 
			"<font color=#999><i>those</i></font> who"&nbsp; instead of 
			&nbsp;"he that"&nbsp; or &nbsp;"he who"? 
			<p>

			<b>Answer:</b>&nbsp; The word sequence:&nbsp; "he that" is incorrect grammar. 
			<p>
			That word sequence appears in 554 verses in the "original" 1611 to 1769 
			English translation and revisions of the Bible;&nbsp; and the word sequence &nbsp;"he which"&nbsp; occurs in 24 verses. 
			<p>
			Many later versions of the Bible have <u>partially</u> corrected this error by 
			substituting the words:&nbsp; "he who"&nbsp; to replace &nbsp;"he that"&nbsp; 
			and &nbsp;"he which." &nbsp; That revision,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; corrects only half of the error. 
			<p>
			The other half of the error is imposing the masculine pronoun &nbsp;"he"&nbsp;
			which is an obsolete relic of ancient male-dominated cultures and language &nbsp;. . .&nbsp; and in most cases,&nbsp; it is simply not an accurate
			translation because there is no underlying Greek word that requires the
			masculine pronoun &nbsp;"he".
			<p>
			Consider this example in Mark 16:16 in which the correct translation is: 
			<br>
			<center> 
			"<font color=#999><i>Those</i></font>&nbsp; who believe and are baptized <br>
			will be saved,<br>
			but &nbsp;<font color=#999><i>those</i></font>&nbsp; who do not believe<br>
			will be damned." <br> 
			</center><p>

			Common sense tells us, that when Yeshua-Jesus is quoted as speaking in this 
			verse &nbsp;(as in many other similar examples),&nbsp; He is not speaking only to male persons as though it were only possible for males to be saved.&nbsp; Rather,&nbsp; it is obvious that He is speaking to or about all human beings,&nbsp; both males and females. 
			<p> 
			In the Greek source text for Mark 16:16 and in hundreds of other instances 
			in which that word sequence is found,&nbsp; there is no underlying Greek word 
			that corresponds to the word "he."&nbsp; The Greek word that is properly 
			translated as the English word "he" is &nbsp;"autoV,"&nbsp; and it appears 
			177 times in the Greek source text of the New Testament. 
			<p>
			In the Greek text of the New Testament, the letter "o" appears 2,567 times 
			as a stand-alone word.&nbsp; In various circumstances,&nbsp; it might be translated as either &nbsp;"who,"&nbsp; "whom,"&nbsp; "the,"&nbsp; "which,"&nbsp; or "this,"&nbsp; among other options. 
			<p>
			Some describe the Greek word &nbsp;"o"&nbsp; as having a masculine attribute 
			in some applications.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;even in instances in which that 
			might be true,&nbsp; that is not a justifiable reason for imposing the 
			masculine pronoun &nbsp;"he"&nbsp; (as many versions still do)&nbsp; in Mark 16:16 and in many dozens of similar contexts. 
			<p>
			The pervasive imposition of masculine pronouns and other masculine gender 
			wording throughout most versions of the Bible is,&nbsp; in most cases,&nbsp;
			not literally accurate,&nbsp; but rather is misleading.&nbsp; 
			<p>
			Without question,&nbsp; the Word of God is intended equally for both 
			females and males. 
			<p>
			Some have suggested that the rendering of Mark 16:16 and other similar 
			passages might be either &nbsp;"All who believe ..."&nbsp; or &nbsp;"Whoever
			believes ..."&nbsp; or &nbsp;"One who believes ..."&nbsp; or &nbsp;"Anyone 
			who believes ..."&nbsp; However,&nbsp; there are problems with each of those proposed translations. 
			<p>
			To begin with,&nbsp; those proposed translations are not literally accurate
			because there is no corresponding word in the Greek text for Mark 16:16 for 
			the words: &nbsp;"All",&nbsp; or &nbsp;"Whoever",&nbsp; or &nbsp;"One",&nbsp;
			or &nbsp;"Anyone".&nbsp; The use of those words imposes an arbitrary 
			interpretation that is not in the source text,&nbsp; and can subtly 
			alter the meaning. 
			<p>
			In the AV7 presentation,&nbsp; masculine gender is retained in every instance 
			where the underlying Greek text and/or the context of a phrase or sentence
			requires it.&nbsp; 
			However,&nbsp; where that is not the case,&nbsp; and where the underlying Greek text does not specifically require a gender-specific word or pronoun to be used,&nbsp; AV7 uses
			the wording:&nbsp; "<font color=#999><i>Those</i></font>&nbsp; who" rather than 
			&nbsp;"he that"&nbsp; or &nbsp;"he who."
