				<b>Question:</b>&nbsp; Why does John 1:16 in The AV7 Bible read:
				<p><center>
				"Of His fullness we have all received,&nbsp;<br>
				and "grace&nbsp;
				<font color=#aaa><i>for everyone</i></font> <br>
				instead of grace&nbsp;
				<font color=#aaa><i>for a favored few</i></font>"?
				</center>
				<p>
				Different versions and paraphrases of the Bible translate this verse in many different ways&nbsp;...&nbsp; but no other version has a translation like The AV7 Bible. &nbsp; <u>Why is that</u>? 
				<p>
				<b>Answer:</b>&nbsp; The reason why The AV7 Bible translation is so different
				from most if not all other translations of the Bible is because AV7 makes a clear distinction between the two significantly different kinds of "grace" that 
				are presented in this verse.
				<p>
				Examine many different versions of the Bible and you will find nearly as many different translations and paraphrases as there are different versions,&nbsp; including these:
				<blockquote>
				<li> grace upon grace 
				<li> grace after grace 
				<li> grace instead of grace 
				<li> grace because of his grace 
				<li> one blessing after another 
				<li> gift after gift after gift 
				<li> favor on top of favor 
				<li> one gift after another 
				<li> ... and many, many more variations. 
				</blockquote>

				All of which can leave a reader very confused.&nbsp; Which is correct?&nbsp; Obviously, all of these very different translations, paraphrases, and readings cannot possibly be equally correct and trustworthy &nbsp;...&nbsp; because:
				<p><center>
				There can never be such a thing as <br>
				different versions of the truth in any given language.</center>
				<p>
				The <b><u>answer</u></b> to determine what translation is correct is to 
				look at the original Greek language source text to see and understand the
				two <u>different</u> Greek words with two <u>different</u> meanings.&nbsp; 
				Both correctly -- but incompletely -- translated as "grace."  However, 
				the Greek word between them is "anti" (which means "against" or "instead of"),
				and this gives us a very revealing clue.&nbsp; Obviously, "grace instead of 
				grace" makes no sense.&nbsp; So, we need to carefully examine and understand 
				the full meanings of the two different Greek words. 
				<p>
				Each of the following Greek words (transliterated into English characters) 
				can be translated "grace;"&nbsp; however each is spelled differently and has a unique meaning:

				<!--<pre><font size=3> -->

				<li>#5484 charin	favor, on account of, before cause of, for sake of
				<li>#5485 charis	graciousness, gratifying, divine influence upon the
						heart and its reflection in the life, gratitude,
						acceptable, benefit, favor, gift, grace, joy,
						pleasure, thankworthy. 
				<li>#5486 charisma	gratuity, deliverance, endowment, qualification,
						miraculous faculty, free gift. 
				<li>#5487 charitoo	grace, indue with special honor, make acceptable, 
						be highly favored.</pre><font class=text>
				To summarize:<br>
				#5484 means grace offered to everyone<br>
				#473 is "anti" which means against or instead of<br>
				#5487 means grace extended to a highly favored or highly honored few.&nbsp; as, for example,&nbsp; it is used in addressing the "highly favored" virgin Mary in Luke 1:28.
