			The Gospel of Jesus Christ 
			as written by John
	  </h1>
	  <h1>
			Chapter 1
      </h1>
      <p>
			1 In the beginning was the Word
			and the Word was with God
			and the Word was God.  Genesis 1:1
      </p>
      <p>
			2	He+ was, in the very beginning, with God.
	  </p>
			3	Everything+ came into existence+ through Him. Without Him nothing would have come+ into existence.
	  </p>
      <p>
			4	In Him was life and the life was the light of men.
	  </p>
      <p>	
			5	The light shines in darkness and the darkness does not overtake+ it.
	  </p>
      <p>	
			6	Now there was a man sent from God whose name was John.
	  </p>
      <p>	
			7	John came as a witness to testify+ of the Light so that through Him everyone might believe.
	  </p>
      <p>	
			8	John was not that Light, but was sent to testify+ of that Light.
	  </p>
      <p>	
			9	This was the true Light, that enlightens+ everyone+ who comes into the world.
	  </p>
      <p>	
			10	He was in the world and the world was made by Him and yet the world did not know Him.
	  </p>
      <p>	
			11	He came to His own and His own did not receive Him. Isaiah 53:3
	  </p>
      <p>	
			12	But to all+ who received Him, He gave authority+ and power to become the children+ of God, even to those who believe on His name,
	  </p>
      <p>	
			13	to those who were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.
