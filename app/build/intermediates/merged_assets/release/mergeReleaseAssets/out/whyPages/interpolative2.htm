			<b>Question:</b>&nbsp; What is the difference between  
			"interpolatively added words" and an "interpretive paraphrase"?
			<p>

			<b>Answer:</b>&nbsp; An "interpretive paraphrase" is a restatement of a text or message 
			using different words than those used by the original writer or speaker. Paraphrases 
			typically reflect the subjective ideas and opinions of the one who writes or retells 
			a message or story in his or her own words.  Writers and speakers are free to take 
			great liberties and latitude in the words they use and the way they relate any 
			message or story that they paraphrase. 
			<p>
			"Interpolatively added words" (as it is done in a <u>very</u> limited way in AV7) is totally different.  The literal accuracy of the original text is preserved intact, and 
			the words that are added, interpolatively, to clarify a meaning are shown in 
			reduced size italic in order to <u>clearly</u> identify the fact that they are added 
			words that were not part of the original text.  
			Thus, the verse or passage can easily be read, overlooking and ignoring the 
			interpolatively added words, to see how a straight literal translation would read. 
			That cannot be done with a paraphrase. 
			<p> 
			There are only four instances in AV7 in which interpolative augmentation is 
			used to any significant extent: John 6:53, Matthew 6:9-13, John 1:16, and 
			Romans 1:17.  In each case, there are important reasons why this was done. 
			Each of these will be explained in its own separate Q/A topic.
