			<b>Question:</b>&nbsp; Why does the AV7 Bible replace the word 
			"brethren" with the word "family<font class=super>+</font>" in many places?
			<p>

			<b>Answer:</b>&nbsp; The Greek root "adelf<font class=super>+</font>" from
			which both words are translated, literally means "from the same womb."
			&nbsp; In most instances, unless the context clearly indicates that
			those being addressed or referenced are specifically all males or
			all females, "family" is generally more accurate than "brethren"
			or "brothers." Obviously, births "from the same womb" can and very
			commonly do include both males and females.
			<p>
			"Brethren" is an archaic term that one rarely if ever hears in
			everyday speech or writing today.  While "brethren" is an
			exclusively masculine term, "family" is an inclusive term that
			refers to both males and females.  "Family" is applicable in a wide
			variety of contexts.  It can refer to blood relatives, or to a mixed
			group of men and women of common beliefs or common interests, or to
			the family of a certain company or city or state or nation, or even
			broadly to the family of mankind. For ultimately, all of humanity
			did indeed come forth from a common ancestor, one woman's womb.
			<p>
			A very compelling point of reference to consider in this regard
			is provided in this quote from Galatians 3:27-28:
			"For all<font class=super>+</font> <i>who</i> have been baptized
			into Christ have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek.
			There is neither bond nor free. There is neither male nor female.
			For you are all one in Christ Jesus."
			<p>
			Surely it is clear beyond doubt or question, that when the Word of
			God, Jesus Christ, and His Apostles addressed great crowds of people,
			they were certainly not speaking only to the males in those crowds,
			but to everyone, both males and females equally. Without question,
			the Word of God and accompanying Scriptures are intended for both
			men and women equally and not just for males to the exclusion
			of females.
			<p>
			The use of masculine pronouns and other masculine terms such as
			"brethren" in traditional English translations of the Bible (and 
			versions that have simply followed that example) and in other
			writing in the past was merely a convention born of patriarchal
			cultures.  There is no technical, etymological, nor contextual basis
			for artificially imposing a masculine attribute to words where the
			context fails to make a specific sex distinction applicable.
			<p>
			Surely no one who reads Mark 16:16 in this archaic style of
			language, "He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved ..."
			would argue that it is only possible for males to believe and
			be baptized.  Therefore, is it not obvious that a much more
			appropriate reading should be: "Those who believe and are
			baptized (including both males and females) shall be saved."
			<p>
			Without question, in many instances in which the word "brethren"
			or "brothers" has been used in the past, the context clearly indicates
			that the audience being addressed was not exclusively males, but
			rather was undoubtedly comprised of both males and females.
			<p>
			The AV7 exhaustive concordance (as shown in the excerpt below)
			identifies 16 variant spellings of "adelf<font class=super>+</font>."
			Five of these are identified by the Strongs number 79 and are
			translated as "sister" or "sisters" in 24 instances.  Of the
			remaining 11 variant spellings, 9 are identified by Strongs number
			80 and two by Strongs number 81.  These may be translated as
			"brethren" or "brother" if and when the context clearly indicates
			that a masculine form is necessary.  If that is not the case,
			however, the inclusive term "family" is surely more fitting.
			<p>
			Contexts provides clarification in many cases. But one must 
			wonder about the efficacy in using "brother" and "brethren" 
			in cases where the context seems clear that a wider audience is intended.

						
			The objective is not to impose a "gender neutral" characteristic 
			but rather to simply achieve "audience inclusive" renderings.

			Conrad: The root elements in the cognate m. and f. words ADELFOS and 
			ADELFH are Alpha sociative and DELF- ("womb"), so that the compound means
			"from the same womb." The words do therefore mean "brother" and "sister"
			in the normal literal sense of children of the same mother, whether or
			not begotten by the same father. But the words, especially the generic
			masculine ADELFOS, have extended senses and may refer to persons with
			whom one shares some sense of kinship by virtue of citizenship or religion
			or whatever. And, it is the special sense of being a fellow-Christian that
			is involved in the common use of the archaic English plural "brethren."
			<p>
			In the NT one will find all three of the usages ... but the question is,
			is it legitimate to understand--and also to TRANSLATE--the specific usage
			of ADELFOS in the sense of "fellow-Christian" to include female believers.
			I would answer that question with a ringing "Yes indeed!"
			<p>
			The answer to this question about ADELFOS is in Galatians 3:27-28:
			among those who have been baptized into Christ, all human distinctions,
			be they social, ethnic, or even biological, cease to matter.
			All who have been baptized into Christ are brothers and sisters without
			distinction of rank or privilege. One has the same kindred relationship
			and the same moral obligations and responsibilities toward all.
			Inasmuch as any human being is capable of redemption, the implications
			of these verses are universally applicable to all human beings.
			<p>
			Re the use of ADELFOS in Matthew's gospel: It is not a problem if one views
			the NT as a corpus of texts that interpret each other. Though it could be
			a problem if one tries to understand what Matthew's gospel means by ADELFOS
			apart from other NT texts.
			<p>
			The problem is this: as a document composed by and for either Jewish Christians or Jews committed to Christ (who have not abandoned Judaism or their ethnic identity as members of Israel), does Mt hold with the patriarachal tradition of Judaism and understand the word ADELFOS to refer only to males.
			<p>
			I think it quite possibly does.  However, even if that were true,
			the gospel of Mt is only one document of the whle of the NT corpus. 
			Therefore, for that reason, the implications of Gal 3:27-28 are applicable
			to anything Mt's gospel says about ADELFOI in the sense of "fellow-Christians."
			<p>
			There are passages in the NT where forms of ADELFOS and of ADELFH should
			be understood in the literal sense of "blood-brother" or "blood-sister."
			There may also be some passages in which the words refer to fellow-nationals
			in a larger group, although this is less common. However, when the words
			are used for "fellow believers," then there is no legitimate reason for understanding them as referring only to males.
			<p>
			Any discerning reader can make distinctions based on context.
			<p>
			Most languages have been shaped by patriarchal traditions in which
			masculine words are used legitimately in a generic sense and there
			are rarely any obviously "inclusive" words.
			<p>
			The word "kin" has the limitation of only referring to blood relations
			and/or mutually-socially-committed persons like members of an ethnic group
			or members of a fraternity. Thus, it is not adequate to clearly express
			the inclusive gender idea that is needed.
			<p>
			Certainly an argument can be made that using "family" is not a sufficiently
			literal translation. In Mt 5:22-24, one could object that such a translation
			appears to extend the obligation even beyond believers, so that anyone angry
			with any other human being may be "in danger of the judgment."
