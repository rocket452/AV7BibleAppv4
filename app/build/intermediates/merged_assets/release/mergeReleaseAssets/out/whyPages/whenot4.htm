			<b>Question:</b>&nbsp; Why does the AV7 Bible include only selected passages from the Old Testament?&nbsp; And when will the entire Old Testament be available with the AV7 presentation attributes? 
			<p>

			<b>Answer:</b>&nbsp; More of the Old Testament will be added in future printed editions of The AV7 Bible and in a continually expanding on-line presentation. 
			<p>
			However, the main focus of The New Authorized Version Foundation is to focus on&nbsp; 
			<a href=http://www.mostessential.com><u>The Most Essential Truths in the Bible</u></a>
			that were literally spoken "out of the mouth of God,"&nbsp; (as emphasized in Matthew 4:4, Luke 4:4, and Deuteronomy 8:3)&nbsp; ... and to invite people to join God's family and encourage them to discover their ultimate mission and purpose in life. 
			<p>
			No portion of the Bible should be ignored, overlooked, or disregarded;&nbsp; however, there are large portions of the Old Testament that are rarely if ever referenced in Bible studies or in pastor's messages.&nbsp; Much of the Old Testament is comprised of historical narrative,&nbsp; genealogical records,&nbsp; biographical data,&nbsp; and other types of information ... all of which is important ... yet The AV7 Bible focuses on those portions in the Bible that are direct statements of <u>declarative instructions</u> and <u>declarations of universal truth</u>.
			<p>
			One of our major objectives is to provide a fresh new presentation of the Bible 
			that is more accurate, more concise, less intimidating, and easier to read and understand.
			<p>
			Over time, The AV7 Bible will add more Old Testament content in new editions; 
			and, God willing, that will eventually include a complete Old Testament.&nbsp; The primary focus of The New Authorized Version Foundation will continue to be to feature and sharpen the focus on "<u>the most essential</u>" passages in the Bible.
