			<b>Question:</b>&nbsp; Why is there a difference of opinion about when the biblical 
			prophecy of "The Great Tribulation" and "The Rapture" will occur?
			<p>
			<b>Answer:</b>&nbsp; In the Bible, there are numerous prophetic passages 
			that foretell of a time of great tribulation when the sun will be darkened, 
			the moon will not give light, the stars will fall from heaven, and 
			the powers of the heavens will be shaken. cf. Isaiah 13:10, 
			Daniel 12:1, Joel 2:10, Matthew 24:21,29, Mark 13:24. 
			<p>
			Some claim that an event that has been called "The Rapture" will 
			occur before this great tribulation period; some claim that "The 
			Rapture" will occur at the mid-point in a predicted 7-year period 
			of tribulation; and some claim that the "Rapture" will occur after 
			the period of great tribulation. The word "rapture," however, does 
			not appear anywhere in the Bible. 
			<p>
			Biblical prophecy is fascinating, and there are many aspects of 
			biblical prophecy that certainly are significant, compelling, and 
			of great importance. However, the debate over whether there will 
			be a pre-tribulation, mid-tribulation, or post-tribulation rapture
			is not important, purposeful, or beneficial. 
			<p>
			The event described in First Thessalonians chapter 4, v14-18, 
			that some have described as "the rapture" is there to provide 
			assurance that all who die as faithful followers of Yeshua-Jesus 
			are simply asleep and one day will be "caught up" to be with the 
			Lord forever. 
			<p>
			The point and purpose of that passage in scripture 
			is to provide assurance and comfort to all believers. Whether 
			this event occurs before, at the mid-point, or after the great 
			tribulation is not what faithful followers should be concerned 
			about. Instead, what is far more important is to learn how to 
			become fully devoted to and invested in trusting and serving 
			the Lord in a purposeful way ... one day at a time.
