							<b>Question:</b>&nbsp; Why is The AV7 Bible not included in other websites
				that present and compare multiple Bible versions? 
				<p>

				<b>Answer:</b>&nbsp; Several reasons.&nbsp; The New Authorized Version Foundation has 
				not authorized the text of The AV7 Bible to be included on websites 
				that present multiple Bible versions as apparently equal in merit for 
				three reasons: 
				<p>
				(1)&nbsp; There can never be such a thing as different yet equally trustworthy 
				versions of the truth in any given language.&nbsp; Therefore, it would be 
				counter-productive to the goal of protecting, preserving, and presenting 
				only the most defensibly accurate and trustworthy truth of the Word of God to
				participate in multiple Bible version presentations that include paraphrases 
				and non-literal versions as apparently being of equal merit. 
				<p>
				(2)&nbsp; To preserve authenticity in presenting word-for-word translation
				accuracy, The AV7 Bible uses reduced sized italic type to clearly identify
				interpolatively added words;&nbsp; plus it uses small superscript "+" flags 
				to clearly identify noteworthy revisions from the benchmark 18th century 
				English text with which The AV7 Bible preserves continuity.&nbsp; These, 
				and other unique AV7 Bible attributes are essential to its presentation.
				<p> 
				(3)&nbsp; One of the major objectives of The AV7 Bible is to provide 
				a presentation of the Bible that is supported by extensive documentation 
				to validate its translation accuracy.&nbsp; This documentation includes 
				interlinear presentation of the most trustworthy Greek original language source 
				text plus The AV7 Bible Greek-English Concordance that presents 17,342 
				unique Greek New Testament words with their catalog and tense-voice-mood 
				identifying numbers, and their corresponding English translation.
