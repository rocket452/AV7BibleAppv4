				<b>Question:</b>&nbsp; How were the passages in AV7 Bible 
				that are described as "most essential" selected?
				<p>
				<b>Answer:</b>&nbsp; <!-- from most184.txt pages 162-163 -->
				The English translation of the Bible contains 790,391 words
				in 31,089 verses.&nbsp; At a very fast reading speed of 200 words 
				per minute,&nbsp; it takes more than 66 hours to read this entire text.
				<p>
				Every word in the Bible is tremendously important;&nbsp;
				but some words 
				and passages in the Bible are significantly more important than others.&nbsp; 
				For example,&nbsp; much of the Bible is comprised of historical narrative,&nbsp; and while all of this historical record is 
				important,&nbsp; the Bible contains certain specific messages to all of mankind that are far more important than its historical content.
				<p>
				The Bible includes many other categories of content such as:&nbsp; 
				genealogical records,&nbsp; eye-witness accounts of supernatural events,&nbsp; prophecy,&nbsp; illustrative allegories,&nbsp; 
				and much, much more.
				<p>
				Among all the different categories of content, it is important to 
				understand that one part of the Bible's content clearly sets the 
				Bible apart from every other book ever written, and that is the 
				declarative instructions and declarations of universal truths that 
				were spoken to mankind directly out of the mouth of of God.
				(cf. Matthew 4:4, Luke 4:4, Deuteronomy 8:3)
				<p>
				By identifying and focusing attention on these particular words 
				in the Bible that were actually spoken "out of the mouth of God,"
				one can distill the Bible to its most essential content in this manner:
				<p>
				The "complete" Bible has 790,391 words in 31,089 verses, requires 66 hours to read<br>
				The New Testament has 180,396 words in 7,957 verses, requires 15 hours to read<br>
				The Four Gospels have 83,885 words in 3,779 verses, requires 7 hours to read<br>
				The "Red Letter" words comprise 39,580 words in 1,932 verses = 3.5 hours to read<br>
				The Most Essential of God's words* = 11,486 words 249 passages = 1 hour to read<br>
				The <b><u>Very Most Essential</u></b> &nbsp;=&nbsp; 2,831 words in 108 passages &nbsp;=&nbsp; 12 minutes to read<br>
				<p>
				The AV7 Bible features and focuses on these Most Essential passages, 
				thereby making it is much easier to quickly and efficiently grasp 
				The Most Essential Truths in the Bible.&nbsp; In this way, one can 
				begin to read the Bible from the inside out!
				<p>
				The complete Bible is actually an extensive library of 66 books -- 
				39 Old Testament books and 27 New Testament books.&nbsp; To read 
				the complete Bible from cover to cover would require reading for 
				at least 10 minutes every single day for a year without ever missing 
				a single day.&nbsp; Or, by reading for one full hour every single day, 
				seven-days a week, one could read the entire Bible in a little more 
				than two months. 
				<p>
				The New Testament is often recommended as a good place to start reading 
				because it focuses on the blessings of faith in God more than on all of 
				the ancient history found in the Old Testament. Yet even starting with 
				the New Testament and reading for 30-minutes every day, it would still 
				take more than a month to read just the complete New Testament.
				<p>
				The Four Gospels are the starting point and most important part of
				the New Testament.&nbsp; The Gospels provide a multi-dimensional, 
				stereo-scopic view of the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, 
				whose name and title are also called &nbsp;"the Word of God."&nbsp; 
				He is the central figure of the entire Bible. 
				<p>
				The "Red Letter" words are all of the words spoken by Jesus, and 
				sometimes printed or displayed in red ink. It is useful to be able 
				to readily distinguish those words in the Bible that were actually 
				spoken &nbsp;"out of the mouth of the Word of God"&nbsp; as His 
				name is called in Revelation 19:13. 
				<p>
				Furthermore, not all of the "Red-Letter" words spoken by Jesus 
				are equal in importance.&nbsp; Some of the "Red-Letter" words are 
				in private conversations of a less "declarative" nature.&nbsp; 
				But certain other passages that are clearly and easily identifiable 
				as most compelling and most essential "declarative instructions" 
				and "declarations of universal truth." 
				<p>
				* Among all of the 790,391 words in the Bible,&nbsp; 
				there are 11,486 words in 249 passages that were literally 
				spoken out of the mouth of God to convey &nbsp;"declarative instructions"&nbsp; and &nbsp;"declarations of universal truth"&nbsp;
				to all mankind.&nbsp; These &nbsp;"Most Essential Truths"&nbsp;
				are the focus of The AV7 Bible study guide:
				<p><center>
				<a href=http://www.MostEssential.com><b>"
				<font color=blue><u>The Most Essential 
				Truth in the Bible</font></u>"</b></a> </center>
				<p>
				Finally,&nbspp; it is possible to identify an even more select 
				"Very Most Essential Truths" comprised of 2,831 words that can 
				be read in only 12 minutes. &nbsp; These key passages are featured in the opening pages of The AV7 Bible.
