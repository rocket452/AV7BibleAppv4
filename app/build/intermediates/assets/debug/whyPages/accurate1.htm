			<b>Question:</b>&nbsp; Why is The AV7 Invitation Bible described 
			as an accurate word-for-word literal translation?
			<p>
			<b>Answer:</b>&nbsp; AV7 is described as an accurate literal translation because it is a word-for-word translation rather than an interpretive paraphrase.&nbsp; Most commercially promoted Bibles in print today are, to one degree or another, interpretive paraphrases that are &nbsp;<u><i>not</i></u>&nbsp; word-for-word literally accurate translations. 
			<p>
			As a word-for-word literal translation, AV7 <u>preserves continuity</u> with that time-honored, yet many times revised and refined English translation that has endured the test of time for nearly 400 years and has been widely accepted as a very trustworthy English translation.&nbsp; While that venerable old Bible text is written in rather archaic language and over time some relatively minor deficiencies have been revealed, it still stands today as a very useful benchmark against which to test and compare other versions. 
			<p>
			In claiming The AV7 Bible as an "accurate literal translation," the objective is to point out the important differences between literal, word-for-word translation and other approaches that do not claim to be word-for-word literally accurate. 
			<p>
			Various approaches used by non-literal translations are sometimes openly acknowledged as being interpretive paraphrases.&nbsp; Regrettably, however, some paraphrases are euphemistically, but improperly described as "dynamic equivalent" or "thought-for-thought" translations.&nbsp; One paraphrase even claims to be "more than a literal translation" in which the publishers claim to be able to present "the thoughts of the original writers" rather than just the original writers' words.
			<p>
			How anyone can claim to know the thoughts of an ancient writer better than that writer's own words is a curious mystery, to say the least.&nbsp; In any case, such interpretive "thought-for-thought" translations typically result in words and messages that are, regrettably, significantly different from the words and messages in an accurate word-for-word translation. 
			<p>
			Therefore, it is wise and prudent for any reader of the Bible to carefully compare "dynamic equivalent" and "thought-for-thought" paraphrase translations with a more literally accurate and trustworthy word-for-word literal translation. 
			<p>
			The New Authorized Version Foundation does not claim that The AV7 Bible is 
			"perfect." If revisions or adjustments are shown to be necessary,&nbsp; any  
			needed adjustments will be openly acknowledged, corrected, and thoroughly 
			documented.
