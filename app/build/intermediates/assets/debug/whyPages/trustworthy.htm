				<b>Question:</b>&nbsp; Is it possible to have different 
				yet equally trustworthy versions of the truth?
				<p>
				<b>Answer:</b> &nbsp; No. 
				<p>
				 
				<hr size=4 width=80% color=darkred><p>

				It is regrettable that so many different translations and "versions" of the Bible have been published in the English language. 
				<p>
				The Bible has been translated into more than 400 different languages,&nbsp; with portions into more than 2,000 languages;&nbsp; and in the vast majority  of those languages there is &nbsp;<u><i>only one</u></i>&nbsp; translation or "version" of the Bible.  
				<p>
				The simple,&nbsp; indisputable fact is &nbsp;. . .&nbsp; that there can never be such a thing as different versions of the truth in any given language;&nbsp; and therefore,&nbsp;there should be 
				&nbsp;<u><i>only one</u></i>&nbsp; translation of the Bible in the English language as well. 
				<p>
				There is absolutely no justifiable reason for there being more than 
				one translation of the Bible in the English language. 
				<p>
				Contemporary-language paraphrases of the Bible may be helpful to some 
				immature readers;&nbsp; however,&nbsp; such readers should always be cautioned to carefully test and compare any interpretive paraphrase that they may use with a more trustworthy,&nbsp; word-for-word-accurate translation. 
				<p>
				The fact that so many different interpretive paraphrases and versions
				of the Bible have been published,&nbsp; promoted,&nbsp; and claimed to be translations of the Bible has,&nbsp; in many instances,&nbsp; seriously undermined the truth of the Bible.
				<p>
				There is only one trustworthy original Greek language source text 
				for the New Testament;&nbsp; and only one trustworthy original Hebrew 
				language source text for the Old Testament.&nbsp; For most of 2,000 
				years,&nbsp; the authenticity and veracity of those original language source 
				texts has been repeatedly reaffirmed in uncountable thousands of ways.
				&nbsp; No foundational truth revealed in those trustworthy sources has ever been disproved,&nbsp; dulled,&nbsp; or diminished by those who have,&nbsp; by their speculations,&nbsp; tried to undermine the veracity of the Bible.
