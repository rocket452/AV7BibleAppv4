				<b>Question:</b>&nbsp; Why does AV7 begin with the book of John
				instead of the book of Matthew? 
				<p>
				<b>Answer:</b>&nbsp; The Gospel as written by John begins with the words, "In the beginning was the Word ..."&nbsp; and it is often recommended as the first book of the Bible for people to read who have not previously read the Bible.
				<p>
				There are many reasons why the the book of John is recommended as a good and perhaps best place to begin reading the Bible.&nbsp; Following are just three reasons:
				<p>
				1) First, the Gospel as written by John is the only one of the four Gospels that is claimed to be an eyewitness account of Jesus' life.&nbsp; It is an eye-witness testimony of a man who was first a disciple of Jesus and later became an Apostle.&nbsp; John described himself as "the disciple whom Jesus loved."&nbsp; John later wrote, this about himself: "This is the disciple who is testifying to these things and wrote these things, and we know that his testimony is true." John 21:24.&nbsp; There is no substantive reason to doubt that it was, in fact, John the disciple of Jesus and later one whom Jesus sent forth as an apostle who wrote
				the Gospel that bears his name. 
				<p>
				2) Second, the Gospel written by John focuses more on spiritual themes moreso than as an historical record.&nbsp; The book is filled with first hand accounts of the writer's experiences with Jesus Christ that occurred during Christ's teaching ministry.&nbsp; 
				<p>
				3) Third, this Gospel account contains vivid lessons and instructions declared by Yeshua-Jesus Christ explaining how to live according to God's will, what priorities are most important in life, and the significance of having a relationship with Him and the difference that relationship can make in one's life. 
				<p>
				More details will be added here later.
