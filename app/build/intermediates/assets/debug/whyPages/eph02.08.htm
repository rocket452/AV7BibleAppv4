			<b>Question:</b>&nbsp; Why does Ephesians 2:8 in The AV7 Bible read: 
			"you are <font color=#777> &nbsp;<i>being</i>&nbsp; </font>
			saved"&nbsp; ... instead of&nbsp; ... 
			"you <u>have been</u> saved" &nbsp; as most other versions read?
			<p>

			<b>Answer:</b> &nbsp; The translation:&nbsp; "you are 
			<font color=#777> &nbsp;<i>being</i>&nbsp;</font> saved"&nbsp; 
			is the accurate rendering because the original language words used
			here are present-tense and/or continuing-tense and definitely not past-tense. 
			<p>
			Please note:&nbsp; In The AV7 Bible,&nbsp; the word 
			<font color=#777> &nbsp;<i>being</i>&nbsp; </font>
			is shown in a reduced-size italic font or in brackets
			or in a lighter color type,&nbsp; to clearly identify
			it as an interpolatively added word. 
			<p>
			The time honored 1611-1769 English text renders this verse
			in this way: &nbsp; "For by grace are ye saved through faith ..."
			<p>
			The word &nbsp;"are"&nbsp; is a present-tense or 
			continuing-tense verb.
			<p>
			It is for a very good reason that it does not read "were ye 
			saved." &nbsp; While the word&nbsp; "saved"&nbsp; might seem 
			at first look to be past tense,&nbsp; it is not. &nbsp;
			In the original Greek source text,&nbsp; is a continuing tense verb.
			<p>
			You might think of the word "saved" here in the sense of being
			"rescued" from a ship that has been damaged in a severe
			storm and taken into a life raft.&nbsp; While one might be "saved" 
			or rescued from a ship that was about to sink,&nbsp; the person rescued is still out in a ferocious storm,&nbsp; and therefore still at risk.&nbsp; One could not really be "saved" (past-tense) in the sense of being completely safe from ferociously churning seas 
			until one eventually (it is hoped) reaches solid ground.
			<p>
			The Greek word "seswsmenoi" is a continuing-tense verb. &nbsp; 
			Strong's Exhaustive Concordance assigns the number 4982.5772
			to this word,&nbsp; and the last four digits identify the 
			applicable tense, voice, and mood of the word,&nbsp; 
			which in this case is continuing tense,&nbsp; and not past tense.
			<p>
			Therefore, to arbitrarily substitute the past tense paraphrase 
			"have been saved" 
			into this sentence artificially interjects and forces a past
			tense reading that is not an accurate translation of the
			original Greek source.&nbsp; There are no underlying Greek words
			in this verse on which to base a translation, "have been saved."
			<p>
			While some have conjectured a man-made doctrine that asserts
			the notion "once saved, always saved," there is no Scriptural
			basis for that conjecture.&nbsp; On the contrary,&nbsp;
			the Bible clearly refutes that false doctrine in many places.
			<p>
			For example,&nbsp; consider Luke 8:13 in which Jesus uses a parable
			to illustrate the sad reality that some will "fall away"
			in times of trials and tribulation because their faith is
			shallow and not genuine. 
			<p>
			Also consider 2 Corinthians 13:5, in which professing believers
			are admonished to "Examine" themselves to see if they are truly
			in the faith.&nbsp; Or, the opposite condition is declared here
			that some will be "reprobates."&nbsp; A reprobate is defined as
			"depraved, unprincipled, or wicked." 
			<p>
			While some may put on a good show,&nbsp; a false front,&nbsp; 
			and a pretense,&nbsp; eventually everyone's true colors will be revealed.&nbsp;
			Just because someone makes a profession of faith and talks a
			good story claiming that they "have been saved" is no guarantee
			that they are truly "saved."&lnbsp; Jesus said,&nbsp;
			"By their fruit, you will know them."&nbsp; Without question,&nbsp;
			some who claim to be "saved" will be found to be counterfeit.&nbsp;
			Remember,&nbsp; Jesus warned us to beware of false teachers and false prophets.
			<p>
			The truth is,&nbsp; that genuine faith is a progressive, ongoing
			process.&nbsp; Remember also that faith an essential component of
			the fruit of the Spirit (as declared in Galatians 5:22).&nbsp;
			One of the evidences of true faith is that true believers will
			continually grow in faith throughout their lives.&nbsp; In contrast
			to that,&nbsp; many who may call themselves "saved" may not really
			be genuinely and totally committed in their profession of faith.&nbsp;
			In 2nd Thessalonians 2:3,&nbsp; the Scripture discloses that
			"... there first [will] come a falling away ..."
			<p>
			In John 5:14,&nbsp; Jesus warned:&nbsp; "Behold, you are made whole.
			Sin no more,&nbsp; lest a worse thing come to you."&nbsp;
			Being "saved" (in the sense of being rescued from any given circumstance) is no guarantee that a person will never fall away
			and lose their salvation.&nbsp; Jesus plainly declared that 
			if someone returns to sinning and continues in sin and persist 
			in sin,&nbsp; then the result will be an appropriate judgment.
			<p>
			In Hebrews 10:26-27,&nbsp; we see further proof of this
			sobering truth:&nbsp; "For if we sin willfully after we have 
			received the knowledge of the truth,&nbsp; there remains no 
			more sacrifice for sins.&nbsps; But <i>there will be</i> 
			a certain fearful expectation+ of judgment and fiery indignation 
			that will devour the adversaries." 
			<p>
			Taking all this into consideration,&nbsp; it is important 
			to understand that as long as we remain alive on the earth,
			we are in a continuing journey through a minefield of
			temptations and risks.&nbsp; God has promised that He will
			save us as long as we continue to put our faith and trust
			in Him and continue to follow Him.
			<p>
			Notice that <u>every</u> instance of the word "saved" in the Bible
			is expressed in a <u>future</u> tense.&nbsp; A few examples: 
			<p>
			Matthew 10:22:&nbsp; "<i>those</i> who endure to the end will be saved."&nbsp; And also consider these passages:&nbsp; 
			Matthew 24:13, Mark 13:13, 16:16; John 10:9; 
			Acts 2:21, 11:14, 15:11, 16:31; 
			Romans 5:9-10, 9:27, 10:9, 10:13, 11:26;
			1 Corinthians 3:15; 1 Timothy 2:15, 4:16 and many more. 
			<p>
			God never did say,&nbsp; "once saved, always saved."
			<p>
			That notion is <u>never</u> stated or implied anywhere in the Bible.&nbsp; Instead, the correct biblical principle is clear: 
			<p><center>
			For by grace you are 
			<font color=#777> &nbsp;<i>being</i>&nbsp; </font>saved<br> 
			through faith, and that not of yourselves.<br>
			<font color=#777> &nbsp;<i>It is</i>&nbsp; </font>
			the gift of God.
