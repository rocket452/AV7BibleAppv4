<font class=T4><center>John Chapter 1</font></center>


<br><span class=T5>1</span><span class=T1> In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God. </span><span class=T3>Genesis 1:1</span> 
<br><span class=T5>2</span><span class=T1> He<span class=T5>+ </span>was, in the </span><span class=T2>very</span> beginning, with God. 
<br><span class=T5>3</span><span class=T1> Everything<span class=T5>+ </span></span><span class=T2>came into</span> existence<span class=T5>+ </span>through Him. Without Him nothing </span><span class=T2>would have</span> come<span class=T5>+ </span>into existence. 
<br><span class=T5>4</span><span class=T1> In Him was life and the life was the light of men. 
<br><span class=T5>5</span><span class=T1> The light shines in darkness and the darkness does not overtake<span class=T5>+ </span>it. 
<br><span class=T5>6</span><span class=T1> </span><span class=T2>Now</span> there was a man sent from God whose name </span><span class=T2>was</span> John. 
<br><span class=T5>7</span><span class=T1> </span><span class=T2>John</span> came as a witness to testify<span class=T5>+ </span>of the Light </span><span class=T2>so</span> that through Him everyone might believe. 
<br><span class=T5>8</span><span class=T1> </span><span class=T2>John</span> was not that Light, but </span><span class=T2>was sent</span> to testify<span class=T5>+ </span>of that Light. 
<br><span class=T5>9</span><span class=T1> </span><span class=T2>This</span> was the true Light, which enlightens<span class=T5>+ </span>everyone<span class=T5>+ </span>who comes into the world. 
<br><span class=T5>10</span><span class=T1> He was in the world and the world was made by Him and </span><span class=T2>yet</span> the world did not know Him. 
<br><span class=T5>11</span><span class=T1> He came to His own and His own did not receive Him. </span><span class=T3>Isaiah 53:3</span> 
<br><span class=T5>12</span><span class=T1> But </span><span class=T2>to</span> all<span class=T5>+ </span></span><span class=T2>who</span> received Him, He gave authority<span class=T5>+ </span></span><span class=T2>and power</span> to become the children<span class=T5>+ </span>of God, </span><span class=T2>even</span> to </span><span class=T2>those</span> who believe on His name, 
<br><span class=T5>13</span><span class=T1> </span><span class=T2>to those</span> who were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God. 
<br><span class=T5>14</span><span class=T1> The Word was made flesh and lived<span class=T5>+ </span>among us and we beheld<span class=T5>~ </span>His glory: Glory as of the Only Begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth. 
<br><span class=T5>15</span><span class=T1> John testified<span class=T5>+ </span>about Him, and called<span class=T5>+ </span></span><span class=T2>out</span> saying: This was He of whom I spoke. He who comes after me is preferred before me because He was before me. 
<br><span class=T5>16</span><span class=T1> Of His fullness we </span><span class=T2>have</span> all received, and grace </span><span class=T2>for everyone</span> instead<span class=T5>+ </span>of grace </span><span class=T2>for a favored few</span>. 
<br><span class=T5>17</span><span class=T1> For the law was given by Moses, </span><span class=T2>but</span> grace and truth came by Jesus Christ. 
<br><span class=T5>18</span><span class=T1> No one has seen God at any time. The Only Begotten Son who is in the bosom<span class=T5>~ </span>of the Father has declared </span><span class=T2>Him</span>. 
<br><span class=T5>19</span><span class=T1> This is the testimony<span class=T5>+ </span>of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him: Who are you? 
<br><span class=T5>20</span><span class=T1> He confessed and did not deny, but confessed: I am not the Christ. 
<br><span class=T5>21</span><span class=T1> They asked him: What then? Are you Elijah? He said: I am not. Are you that prophet? He answered: No. 
<br><span class=T5>22</span><span class=T1> Then they said to him: Who are you? </span><span class=T2>Tell us so</span> that we may give an answer to </span><span class=T2>those</span> who sent us. What do you say of yourself? 
<br><span class=T5>23</span><span class=T1> He said: I </span><span class=T2>am</span> the voice of one crying in the wilderness: Make straight the way of the Lord, as the prophet Isaiah said. </span><span class=T3>Isaiah 40:3</span> 
<br><span class=T5>24</span><span class=T1> </span><span class=T2>Those</span> who were sent </span><span class=T2>to John</span> were of the Pharisees. 
<br><span class=T5>25</span><span class=T1> They asked him and said to him: Why do you baptize then? If you are not the Christ or Elijah or that prophet? 
<br><span class=T5>26</span><span class=T1> John answered them saying: I baptize with water but there stands one among you whom you do not know. 
<br><span class=T5>27</span><span class=T1> It is He, who, coming after me, is preferred before me. I am not </span><span class=T2>even</span> worthy to loosen His sandal<span class=T5>+ </span>straps<span class=T5>+</span>. 
<br><span class=T5>28</span><span class=T1> These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan where John was baptizing. 
<br><span class=T5>29</span><span class=T1> The next day John saw Jesus coming to him and </span><span class=T2>he</span> said: Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. 
<br><span class=T5>30</span><span class=T1> This is He of whom I said: After me comes a man who is preferred before me, because He was before me. 
<br><span class=T5>31</span><span class=T1> I did not know Him, but I came baptizing with water </span><span class=T2>so</span> that He might be made known<span class=T5>+ </span>to Israel. 
<br><span class=T5>32</span><span class=T1> </span><span class=T2>Then</span> John testified<span class=T5>+ </span>saying: I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it </span><span class=T2>came to</span> reside<span class=T5>+ </span>on Him. 
<br><span class=T5>33</span><span class=T1> I did not know Him, but He who sent me to baptize with water said to me: </span><span class=T2>The one</span> upon whom you shall see the Spirit descending and remaining on Him is </span><span class=T2>the One</span> who baptizes with the Holy Spirit. 
<br><span class=T5>34</span><span class=T1> I saw and testify<span class=T5>+ </span>that this is the Son of God. 
<br><span class=T5>35</span><span class=T1> Again the next day, after John stood with two of his disciples 
<br><span class=T5>36</span><span class=T1> looking at Jesus as He walked </span><span class=T2>by</span>, he said: Behold the Lamb of God. 
<br><span class=T5>37</span><span class=T1> The two disciples heard him say this and they followed Jesus. 
<br><span class=T5>38</span><span class=T1> Then Jesus turned, saw them following, and said to them: <font color=red>What are you seeking?</font> They said to Him: Rabbi, meaning<span class=T5>+ </span>Master. Where do you live? 
<br><span class=T5>39</span><span class=T1> He said to them: <font color=red>Come and see.</font> </span><span class=T2>So</span> they went </span><span class=T2>with Him</span> and saw where He lived<span class=T5>+ </span>and stayed<span class=T5>+ </span>with Him that day, for it was about four </span><span class=T2>in the afternoon</span>. 
<br><span class=T5>40</span><span class=T1> One of the two who heard John </span><span class=T2>speak</span> and followed </span><span class=T2>Jesus</span> was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. 
<br><span class=T5>41</span><span class=T1> He first found his own brother Simon and said to him: We have found the Messiah who is called<span class=T5>+ </span>the Christ. 
<br><span class=T5>42</span><span class=T1> </span><span class=T2>Andrew</span> brought </span><span class=T2>his brother</span> to Jesus and when Jesus saw<span class=T5>+ </span>him He said: <font color=red>You are Simon the son of Jonah. You shall be called Cephas.</font> That is translated<span class=T5>+ </span>Peter<span class=T5>+</span>, </span><span class=T2>which means a steadfast stone</span>. 
<br><span class=T5>43</span><span class=T1> The next<span class=T5>+ </span>day, Jesus went<span class=T5>+ </span>to Galilee, found Philip, and said to him: <font color=red>Follow me.</font> 
<br><span class=T5>44</span><span class=T1> Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the </span><span class=T2>same</span> city as Andrew and Peter. 
<br><span class=T5>45</span><span class=T1> Philip found Nathanael and said to him: We have found Him of whom Moses in the law and the prophets wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph. 
<br><span class=T5>46</span><span class=T1> Nathanael said to him: Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip said to him: Come and see. 
<br><span class=T5>47</span><span class=T1> Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him and said of him: <font color=red>Behold an Israelite indeed in whom is no guile~.</font> 
<br><span class=T5>48</span><span class=T1> Nathanael said to </span><span class=T2>Jesus</span>: From where do you know me? Jesus answered and said to him: <font color=red>Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.</font> 
<br><span class=T5>49</span><span class=T1> Nathanael answered and said to Him: Rabbi, you are the Son of God. You are the King of Israel. 
<br><span class=T5>50</span><span class=T1> Jesus answered and said to him: <font color=red>Because I said to you </span><span class=T2>that</span> I saw you under the fig tree you believe? You shall see greater things than these.</font> 
<br><span class=T5>51</span><span class=T1> </span><span class=T2>Then Jesus</span> said to him: <font color=red>Truly<span class=T5>+</span>, truly, I say to you: Hereafter you will see heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</font>
