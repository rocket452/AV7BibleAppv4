<font class=T4><center>John Chapter 3</font></center>

<br><span class=T5>1</span><span class=T1> </span><span class=T2>Now</span> there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. 
<br><span class=T5>2</span><span class=T1> He came to Jesus by night and said to Him: Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these miracles<span class=T5>~ </span>that you do, unless<span class=T5>+ </span>God is with them. 
<br><span class=T5>3</span><span class=T1> Jesus answered and said to him: <font color=#A00000>Truly<span class=T5>+</span>, truly, I say to you: Unless<span class=T5>+ </span>a person<span class=T5>+ </span>is born again, they cannot see the kingdom of God.</font> 
<br><span class=T5>4</span><span class=T1> Nicodemus said to Him: How can anyone<span class=T5>+ </span>be born when they are old? Can they enter a second time into their mother's womb and be born? 
<br><span class=T5>5</span><span class=T1> Jesus answered: <font color=#A00000>Truly<span class=T5>+</span>, truly, I say to you: Unless<span class=T5>+ </span>a person<span class=T5>+ </span>is born of water and </span><span class=T2>of</span> the Spirit, they cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</font> 
<br><span class=T5>6</span><span class=T1> <font color=#A00000></span><span class=T2>Those</span> who are born of flesh are flesh, and </span><span class=T2>those</span> who are born of the Spirit are spirit.</font> 
<br><span class=T5>7</span><span class=T1> <font color=#A00000>Do not marvel that I said to you: You must be born again.</font> 
<br><span class=T5>8</span><span class=T1> <font color=#A00000>The wind blows where it will<span class=T5>+ </span>and you hear the sound of it, but </span><span class=T2>you</span> cannot tell from where it comes and where it goes. So </span><span class=T2>it</span> is </span><span class=T2>with</span> everyone who is born of the Spirit.</font> 
<br><span class=T5>9</span><span class=T1> Nicodemus answered and said to Him: How can these things be? 
<br><span class=T5>10</span><span class=T1> Jesus answered and said to him: <font color=#A00000>Are you a master of Israel and do not understand<span class=T5>+ </span>these things?</font> 
<br><span class=T5>11</span><span class=T1> <font color=#A00000>Truly<span class=T5>+</span>, truly, I say to you: We speak what we know and testify </span><span class=T2>about</span> what we have seen, but you do not receive our witness.</font> 
<br><span class=T5>12</span><span class=T1> <font color=#A00000>If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you </span><span class=T2>about</span> heavenly things?</font> 
<br><span class=T5>13</span><span class=T1> <font color=#A00000>No one has ascended up to heaven except<span class=T5>+ </span>He who came down from heaven, </span><span class=T2>even</span> the Son of man who is in heaven.</font> 
<br><span class=T5>14</span><span class=T1> <font color=#A00000></span><span class=T2>Just</span> as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so the Son of man must be lifted up</font> 
<br><span class=T5>15</span><span class=T1> <font color=#A00000></span><span class=T2>so</span> that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.</font> </span><span class=T3>Proverbs 8:35</span> 
<br><span class=T5>16</span><span class=T1> <font color=#A00000>For God so loved the world, that He gave His Only Begotten Son, </span><span class=T2>so</span> that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal<span class=T5>+ </span>life.</font> 
<br><span class=T5>17</span><span class=T1> <font color=#A00000>For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but </span><span class=T2>so</span> that the world through Him might be saved.</font> 
<br><span class=T5>18</span><span class=T1> <font color=#A00000></span><span class=T2>Those</span> who believe in Him are not condemned, but </span><span class=T2>those</span> who do not believe are condemned already, because they have not believed in the name of the Only Begotten Son of God.</font> 
<br><span class=T5>19</span><span class=T1> <font color=#A00000>And this is the condemnation: That light has come into the world, but people<span class=T5>+ </span></span><span class=T2>have</span> loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</font> 
<br><span class=T5>20</span><span class=T1> <font color=#A00000>For everyone who does evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest their deeds should be proved<span class=T5>+ </span></span><span class=T2>evil</span>.</font> 
<br><span class=T5>21</span><span class=T1> <font color=#A00000>But </span><span class=T2>those</span> who do truth come to the light </span><span class=T2>so</span> that their deeds may be made known<span class=T5>+</span>, that they are worked<span class=T5>+ </span>in God.</font> 
<br><span class=T5>22</span><span class=T1> After these things, Jesus and His disciples went<span class=T5>+ </span>into the land of Judea, and He stayed<span class=T5>+ </span>there with them and baptized. 
<br><span class=T5>23</span><span class=T1> John was also baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there and </span><span class=T2>the people</span> came and were baptized. 
<br><span class=T5>24</span><span class=T1> For John had not yet been cast into prison. 
<br><span class=T5>25</span><span class=T1> Then a question arose between </span><span class=T2>some</span> of John's disciples and the Jews about purifying. 
<br><span class=T5>26</span><span class=T1> They came to John and said to him: Rabbi, the one who was with you beyond Jordan, to whom you bear witness, behold He is baptizing and everyone<span class=T5>+ </span>is going<span class=T5>+ </span>to Him. 
<br><span class=T5>27</span><span class=T1> John answered and said: A person<span class=T5>+ </span>can receive nothing unless<span class=T5>+ </span>it is given </span><span class=T2>to</span> them from heaven. 
<br><span class=T5>28</span><span class=T1> You yourselves </span><span class=T2>can</span> testify<span class=T5>+ </span>that I said: I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before Him. 
<br><span class=T5>29</span><span class=T1> One who has a bride is a bridegroom, but the friend of the bridegroom who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice. Therefore, my joy is fulfilled in this. 
<br><span class=T5>30</span><span class=T1> He must increase but I </span><span class=T2>must</span> decrease. 
<br><span class=T5>31</span><span class=T1> He who comes from above is above all. </span><span class=T2>Those</span> who are of the earth are earthly and speak </span><span class=T2>about</span> earthly </span><span class=T2>things</span>. He who comes from heaven is above all. 
<br><span class=T5>32</span><span class=T1> He testifies </span><span class=T2>about</span> what He has seen and heard, but no one receives His testimony. 
<br><span class=T5>33</span><span class=T1> </span><span class=T2>Those</span> who have received His testimony have </span><span class=T2>given their</span> seal<span class=T5>~ </span></span><span class=T2>of affirmation</span> that God is true. 
<br><span class=T5>34</span><span class=T1> For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God does not give the Spirit </span><span class=T2>in a limited</span> measure. </span><span class=T3>Matthew 4:4</span> 
<br><span class=T5>35</span><span class=T1> The Father loves the Son and has given all things into His hand. 
<br><span class=T5>36</span><span class=T1> </span><span class=T2>Those</span> who believe in the Son have eternal<span class=T5>+ </span>life. </span><span class=T2>Those</span> who do not believe the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains<span class=T5>+ </span>on them.
